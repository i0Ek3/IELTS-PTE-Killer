> This essay addresses the task, presenting both sides of the argument and offering a clear position at the end. However, there are several language issues that impact clarity and coherence, as well as errors in grammar and sentence structure. Below are some detailed comments and suggestions for improvement.

The issue of whether university students should learn other subjects or pay more attention to get qualification has sparked widespread discussion. On one hand, some people advocate that university students should learn about other subjects. On the other hand, others hold the opinion that they should pay more attention to their qualification. In this essay, both viewpoints will be analyzed before presenting my own stance.

Those who support university students should learn extra subjects argue that learn more relative or unrelative subjects may bring more opportunities and insights among the students. By doing this, you have more chances to make connection with different people those who comes from unrelative fields, which can imporve your confidence and the ability of absorb the new things. To illustrate, you could learn something about biology after your main course of computer science, which means that you will contact with the teachers and students from this fields and the potential opportunity is comming. This shows that the beneficial of learn other subjects after main course.

However, proponents of university students should pay more attention on their qualification claim that you could learn other deciplines easily after you work few years. One example of this is you work as backend develop engineer at huge tech company for nearly three years and then you want to turn to the aother fields like artifical intenligence, since you have some relative experiences and work connections, thus you will easy transform to this fields with minimal cost. Therefore, I am more inclined to pay more attention on qualification as my point.

In conclusion, both learn other subjects and pay more time to their qualification have their merits and demerits. However, considering all the factors, I am inclined to support the view that university students should pay more attention to their qualification.
