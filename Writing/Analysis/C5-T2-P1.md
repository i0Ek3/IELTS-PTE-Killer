## Before

As we can see from the charts which show us two reasons for study among students of different age group and the amount of support by company, which is separate to five parts with different age group, and the chart below shows different trend whose supported by employer.

There is an explicit trend of different reason for study, which is study for career is decrease when age become older, and study for interest is increase. However, study for career under the age 26 was taken 80% and study for interest under the age 26 was taken only 10%. While age over 49, study for career was taken about 19% and study for interest was taken about 70%. This phenomenon indicates the trend of study capability of different age group.

While study supported by employer, there is a different situation. Almost 62% under the age of 26 was taken, and age between 30 and 39, the proportion just drops out, and then the proportion was increase when age over 49. Which means most of the middle age people have more stuff to do, and the young and old group have not much stuff to do, they have enough time to learn. 

## Overall Score: 5.0

The response addresses the task but shows limitations in all criteria. The main features are identified but not always clearly reported or compared. The organization is somewhat coherent but lacks overall progression. The vocabulary and grammatical structures are limited, with frequent errors that sometimes impede understanding.

## After

As we can see from the charts, which show two reasons for study among students of different age groups and the amount of support they received from employers, the data is separated into five age groups. The chart below shows different trends in employer support.

There is a clear trend in the reasons for study: studying for career purposes decreases as age increases, while studying for interest increases. However, studying for career purposes accounted for 80% among those under 26, while studying for interest only accounted for 10% in this age group. For those aged over 49, studying for career purposes accounted for about 19%, while studying for interest accounted for about 70%. This phenomenon indicates the trend in study preferences among different age groups.

Regarding employer support for study, the situation is different. Almost 62% of those under the age of 26 received employer support. For the age group between 30 and 39, the proportion drops significantly, and then it increases again for those over 49. This suggests that middle-aged people have more responsibilities, while the younger and older groups have fewer commitments and thus more time for learning.

## Structure

The structure does not fit the requirements of an IELTS Task 1 response. Here's a revised structure:

- Introduction: Paraphrase the question and state what the charts show
- Overview: Summarize 2-3 main trends from both charts
- Body Paragraph 1: Detailed description of trends in reasons for study across age groups
- Body Paragraph 2: Detailed description of trends in employer support across age groups
- Body Paragraph 3 (optional): Comparison of the two sets of data
- Conclusion: Brief summary of key points (if word count allows)

## High Score Example

The charts illustrate the primary motivations for study among different age groups of students, as well as the level of employer support they receive. 

Regarding reasons for study, there is a clear inverse relationship between age and career-focused motivation. For students under 26, career reasons dominate at 80%, while interest-based study accounts for only 10%. This trend reverses steadily with age, as those over 49 are primarily motivated by interest (70%) rather than career advancement (19%). This shift likely reflects changing priorities and circumstances across the lifespan. 

The pattern of employer support shows a different trajectory. It is highest for the youngest group, with about 62% of those under 26 receiving support. Support then drops sharply for those aged 30-39, before gradually increasing again for older age groups. By the over-49 category, employer support has risen to around 57%, nearly matching the level for the youngest cohort. This U-shaped trend may indicate that employers invest more in training very junior and senior staff, while mid-career professionals receive less support, possibly due to higher workloads or expectations of self-directed development. 

Overall, these charts reveal how motivations for study and access to employer support evolve across different career stages, with notable shifts in priorities and resources available to learners as they age.
