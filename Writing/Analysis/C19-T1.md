# C19-T1 Writing

全套真题按时模拟，Task 1 用了 10 分钟就写完了，Task 2 用了 20 分钟吧，感觉这个题目先对简单点。让 ChatGPT 评分，5.5，不知道准不准，反正好拉跨。

## Task 1

The line graph illustrates the numbers of participants of different activities at one social centre in Australia during the period from 2000 to 2020.

It it clear that the film club activity were more popular than others. Whereas the activity musical perfomances without any attention in 2020, and the acitivity amateur dramatics experienced a decline from 2005.

In 2000, film club got aroud 64 pariticipants more than other activities, for example martial arts, amateur dramatics and table tennis was by 36, 26 and 16 representively. However, there is no pariticipant on musical performances in 2000 until 2005. After 2005, amateur dramatics experienced a level off decline until 2020. At the same time, musical performances show an upward trend to almost 19 participants in 2020. After 2010, table tennis show a rocket increase until 2020. In 2020, film club still remail the highest pariticipants which was 66, and amateur dramatics got the lowest participants which was 6.

## Task 2

There is an ongoing debate on whether keep competition or not. Some people believe that competition is a good thing in many aspects, whereas others hold the opposite perspective, claiming that people should cooperate more than competing against each other. In this essay, we will discuss both pros and cons before commenting my on stance.

On the one hand, competition contributes more positive points to our life and soical change. Competition may sitimulate our potential capabilities to create things. For example, artist need more insprits to create work of art when they stay at quiet place. However, if there are other artists do the same thing at same place, they will feel the pressure and then they could create higher quilty work. On the other hand, competition propel the revolution of technology. If there only one company pursuing aritfical intelligence and large language model, and without other companies do research in this field, I do not think OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini could become top-notch.

However, cooperation also play an significant role to our personality and social skills. Cooperation is a good thing to shape children's personality in school with a positive way. For instance, under the lead of teachers, students will learn how to share ideas and work together effectively. They could achieve higher achievement through discussion with each other. In contrast, those students who do not like share and cooperation will become more selfish after their later life. Furthermore, cooperation also contribute to social skills for any age groups.

In conclusion, and for my own view, both competition and cooperation are contribute equal importance to our life and social developement, we should not talk about them respectively.
