## Before

In my view, universities should accept equal numbers of different gender of student in each subject. To do this, universities can be more diversity and attractive.

Equal numbers of different gender students could bring diversity and selective to campus. There's a giant gap between females and men which have distincly thinking framework to exploring, understanding and interacting with this world. Imaging this scenario, the university only have male students or few female students those who don't understand each other different gender students may cost much time to know what is the difference between males and females.

Nowadays, a numbers of subjucts require female students involve instead of male students. For example Art, Psycology and Education. Because of female students could feel more emotional changes than males which required by such subjects. As consequently, female students can also improve quality and funny of the class, because of female students could pay more attentions and patience than males. 

To conclude, universities requires equal numbers of different gender students instead of disorder proportion which could accelerate the uneven picture of society steady.

## After

In my view, universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in each subject. By doing this, universities can become more diverse and attractive.

Equal numbers of male and female students could bring diversity and selectivity to campus. There's a significant difference between females and males in their distinct thinking frameworks for exploring, understanding, and interacting with the world. Imagine a scenario where a university has only male students or very few female students. In such a case, students who don't understand the opposite gender may need a lot of time to learn about the differences between males and females. 

Nowadays, a number of subjects require more female students to be involved rather than male students. For example Art, Psycology and Education. This is because female students are often considered to be more attuned to emotional changes than males, which is a quality required by such subjects. As consequently, female students can also improve quality and funny of the class, because of female students could pay more attentions and patience than males. 

To conclude, universities require equal numbers of female and male students instead of disorder proportion which could accelerate the uneven picture of scoiety steady.

## High Score Example(7.5)

The question of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is a complex and contentious issue. While gender equality in education is an important goal, I believe a more nuanced approach is necessary. 

There are compelling arguments in favor of gender parity across university programs. Ensuring equal representation could help break down gender stereotypes associated with certain fields and create more diverse, balanced learning environments. This diversity of perspectives often leads to more innovative thinking and prepares students for working in mixed-gender professional settings. Additionally, actively working towards equal gender ratios could help address historical imbalances that have disadvantaged women in fields like STEM. 

However, strictly enforcing a 50-50 gender split in every subject regardless of applicant numbers or qualifications raises some concerns. It could potentially lead to reverse discrimination, where highly qualified applicants of one gender are rejected in favor of less qualified applicants of another gender simply to meet quotas. This approach might also fail to account for genuine differences in interest levels between genders for certain subjects - differences which may stem from societal factors but are nonetheless present in the current applicant pool. 

A more balanced approach might involve universities setting aspirational targets for gender diversity rather than strict quotas. They could focus on addressing root causes of gender imbalances through early education initiatives, mentorship programs, and efforts to make traditionally gendered fields more welcoming to all. Universities could also work to eliminate gender bias in their admissions processes without mandating specific ratios.

Ultimately, while striving for greater gender balance in university programs is a worthy goal, it should be pursued thoughtfully and in conjunction with broader societal efforts to promote gender equality. The primary focus should remain on admitting the most qualified and promising students, while actively working to broaden the pool of qualified applicants from underrepresented genders in various fields.
