## Teenagers should be required to do unpaid work to community?

青少年不应该无薪为社区工作。

论点1：青少年的主要任务应该是继续完成学业，而不是花更多的时间在社区工作。等他们毕业了，有的是时间工作，现在就把中心放到工作上，会让他们日后的可选择性大大降低。想象一下，一个高中没有毕业的学生，在社会上会找到一个什么样的工作，从而能够养家糊口呢？

论点2：青少年如果免费为社区工作，会滋生一些不必要的资源浪费。那些雇主可能会不珍惜这样的资源，反而存在白嫖行为。另一方面，青少年既无法很好的锻炼技能，也无法更好得到应有的报酬，会让他们对这样的工作产生落差，从而影响日后的工作。

There is an ongoing debate whether teenagers should be required to do some unpaid work to commuity. However, I do not think that unpaid work to community can bring more benefit for teenagers.

Firstly, finishing study is a mainly task for teenagers instead of pay more attention on community unpaid work. After they are graduated from high school, there are more choices for them to take works. If they are turned core into work, there would be less possibilities for work selection in the future. By doing this, one is not graduated from high school without any skills and knowledge, what job would they get easily and hold family well-lived?

Secondly, there would be more resources wasted by teenages doing unpaid work to community. It is obvious that employers cannot perish these resources which are free for them. Moreover, the employer will do something bad on these teenagers, for example, let them work overtime or do something which are they should not do. On the other hand, unpaid work make teenagers feel utilized by these people and they cannot get positive feedback, and cannot learn any useful skills. In fact, all of these behaviour will take neagtive impact to them when they need to decide which work they are really like and dive into.

In conclusion, I do not think that teenagers do these unpaid work to community can bring positive impact. By contrast, I do think that teenagers should finish their study work first.

### After(kimi, band 8.5)

There is an ongoing debate about whether teenagers should be required to participate in unpaid community service. However, I believe that mandatory unpaid work may not be the most beneficial use of a teenager's time.

Firstly, the primary task for teenagers should be to focus on their studies rather than diverting their attention to unpaid community work. Once they graduate from high school, they will have a wider array of career options available to them. If they become too focused on work, there may be fewer opportunities for them to explore different career paths in the future. Without a high school diploma and marketable skills, what kind of job would they easily obtain and how could they hope to support themselves and their families?

Secondly, there is a potential waste of resources when teenagers engage in unpaid work. It is clear that employers might not value or manage resources as carefully when the labor is provided for free. Furthermore, employers might exploit these young workers, for instance, by making them work overtime or assigning them tasks that are inappropriate or unsafe. On the other hand, unpaid work might lead teenagers to feel undervalued and exploited, without receiving positive feedback or learning useful skills. In fact, these negative experiences could have a detrimental impact on their future career choices and work ethic.

In conclusion, I do not believe that mandatory unpaid community work would have a positive impact on teenagers. On the contrary, I think teenagers should prioritize their education first.

## Government should give finnancial support to creative artists?

论点1：应该。但是资助不是无条件的，可以通过评估其作品质量进行资助，以激励他们更好地发挥才能，为这个社会的文化艺术气息增添光彩。同时应无条件为那些较为穷困且有艺术追求的艺术家进行资助，以帮助他们更好地度过困难时期。

论点1：不应该。各行各业都有各自的竞争力，如果资助了艺术创作，那么其他领域也会寻求资助，但是对于政府来说这是不小的压力。因此，可以对少部分高质量的以及有很好的社会贡献力的艺术创作进行资助。

### Before(me, band 6)

There is an ongoing debate whether government should give finnancial support to creative artists. In my opinion, finnancial support shouldn't be an unconditional incentive, which means government should give limited finnancial support to those who give this society tremendous impact.

On the one hand, finnacial support shouldn't be an unconditional behavior. The government should give finnacial support to those creative artists who did high-level artworks in order that sitimulate them to release creative talents, which can bring cultural and art astomersphere for this society. Meanwhile, the government should give finnacial support unconditionally to those artists who have high demanding to art, which can help them to overcome that tough moment.

On the other hand, the government shouldn't give finnacial support to creative artists. Because of there are much fierce competitions between the artist. If government support those artists and there should be other people asking for support either, which is a huge press to government.

In conclusion, I do not believe that government should give finnacial support to artists unconditionally, insteading government should give limited finnacial support to those people who have positive impact to this society.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is an ongoing debate about whether the government should provide financial support to creative artists. In my opinion, financial support should not be unconditional; instead, it should be offered selectively to those artists who make a substantial impact on society. 

On the one hand, financial support should be targeted. The government should offer financial support to artists who produce high-quality work, in order to stimulate their creativity and foster a rich cultural and artistic atmosphere in society. For instance, unconditional support could be given to artists with a profound dedication to their craft, helping them through difficult times. 

On the other hand, some argue that the government should not provide financial support to artists. They point out the intense competition among artists; if the government supports some, others will also demand support, placing a significant burden on the government. 

In conclusion, I do not believe that the government should offer financial support to artists unconditionally. Instead, the government should provide limited, targeted financial support to those individuals whose work positively impacts society.

### After(Claude, band 8)

There is an ongoing debate about whether governments should provide financial support to creative artists. In my opinion, while such support can be beneficial, it should not be offered unconditionally. Instead, I believe that governments should provide limited financial assistance to those artists who make significant contributions to society.

Firstly, financial support should be granted judiciously and based on merit. Governments should allocate funds to artists who consistently produce high-quality work, as this approach can stimulate their creativity and encourage them to further develop their talents. This, in turn, can enrich the cultural and artistic atmosphere of society. For instance, providing grants to promising young painters or musicians can enable them to focus on their craft, potentially leading to groundbreaking artworks or compositions that elevate the nation's cultural standing. Additionally, established artists facing temporary financial hardships could receive support to help them overcome challenging periods, ensuring that valuable artistic voices are not lost due to economic pressures.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of government funding for the arts. The art world is highly competitive, and providing financial support to some artists may create a sense of inequality or favoritism. This could lead to resentment among those who do not receive funding and potentially stifle the natural evolution of artistic movements. Moreover, if the government becomes too involved in funding the arts, there is a risk of influencing artistic expression, potentially compromising the independence and authenticity of creative works. For example, artists might be tempted to conform to government preferences to secure funding, rather than pursuing their true artistic vision.

To strike a balance, I propose that governments implement a transparent and merit-based system for allocating financial support to artists. This system should consider factors such as the artist's track record, the potential societal impact of their work, and their financial need. Furthermore, the support should be time-limited and subject to regular review, ensuring that funds are used effectively and that a diverse range of artists can benefit over time.

In conclusion, while I do not advocate for unconditional financial support for all artists, I believe that a carefully managed system of limited government funding can play a crucial role in nurturing artistic talent and enriching our cultural landscape. By supporting those who demonstrate exceptional skill and potential to positively impact society, governments can foster a thriving artistic community without unduly influencing the natural development of creative expression.

## Should ban testing on animals?

论点1：不该禁止。从人类整体的福祉考虑，动物实验可以测试新药以及治疗绝症，可以为人类以及其他动物带来新的机遇。此外，有些动物的基因和人类很相似，可以更好地进行测试，从而将研究成果应用到人类身上。因此在没有找到其他可以测试研究的方案之前，不应禁止动物实验。

论点2：应该禁止。动物也是有感情的，它们可以理解当下环境的情况。用动物做实验会导致动物本身的痛苦，以及影响生态平衡，降低动物种族的数量。

### Before(me, band 6)

There is an argument on whether ban testing on animals among the people. In my opinion, we can use animals to test state-of-art researches in a limited situation.

Considerably, we shouldn't ban testing on animals, because of some animals can be used to testing new drugs and do novelty researches, which is helpful to understand and heal human beings themselves. Therefore, we should use limited numbers of animal before finding a new solution which can be used to testing drugs. 

Counterpartly, animal testing should be banned under the moral framework and balanced ecosystem. It is true that animals also have feelings and emotions. They can feel the pain and understand the situations under the different astomespheres. Additionally, animals testing will reduce the number of it's flocks, and also impact the balance of ecosystem.

Broadly speaking, I do not think that ban testing on animals can solve basic problems of our human beings faced in a long way.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is an ongoing debate on whether animal testing should be banned. In my opinion, animals can be used for testing cutting-edge research in a limited set of circumstances.

On the one hand, we shouldn't ban animal testing because some animals can be used to test new drugs and conduct novel research, which can help us understand and treat human ailments. Therefore, we should use a limited number of animals for testing until we find an alternative solution.

On the other hand, animal testing should be banned under the moral framework and for the sake of ecological balance. It is true that animals also have feelings and emotions. They can feel pain and understand their environments. Additionally, animal testing can reduce populations and impact the balance of ecosystems.

In conclusion, I do not believe that banning animal testing would address the fundamental issues our species faces in the long term. Instead, we should seek alternatives while recognizing the necessity in specific, limited situations.

## Born with certain talents or can be taught?

### Before(me, band 6)

There is a firce debate whether the talent is born with or can be teach. However, it really depends. In some fields, for example, mathmatical and physical, people were required certain talents which is born with. And in other fields such as psycology, you can be a talent by teaching.

There are serveral fields need people born with talents. For example, mathmatical, physical and algorithm are also requires highly logical ability. As an example, Alstein is a famous and talent physist who was proposed the relative theory which is sophisicated physical theory and applied broadly. This is a breaking inovation of this world. However, if there is no such people like Alstein, our world still may remain on primitive stage.

There is also are opportunities for those people who bornt normally. The true that most of people are under this range. For example, for now, Cao is a famous singer who write songs for  those super stars. But before that, you may even don't know him or never heard of him. He is really like sing songs and want be a singer. However, there is no music producer want sign him, but he never give up and he practice sing ability harder more than ever. And one day, his song just on the top, he just made it happen.

In conculsion, those fields which are required strong logical exactly need people born with talents. By contrast, those fields which are required emotional needs can be taugh.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is a fierce debate over whether talent is innate or can be taught. However, it really depends. In some fields, for example, mathematics and physics, people require certain innate talents. And in other fields such as psychology, one can become talented through teaching.

There are several fields that need individuals born with talent. For example, in mathematics, physics, and algorithm design, highly logical abilities are required. As an example, Einstein was a famous and talented physicist who proposed the theory of relativity, a sophisticated physical theory that is widely applied. This was a groundbreaking innovation for our world. However, without individuals like Einstein, our world might still be at a primitive stage.

There are also opportunities for those born with ordinary abilities. The truth is that most people fall into this range. For example, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was not an overnight success. He faced many rejections and failures before he became one of the most successful businessmen in the world. His story shows that with perseverance and hard work, one can achieve great things even without exceptional innate talent.

In conclusion, fields that require strong logical abilities do need individuals born with talent. By contrast, fields that require emotional intelligence can be taught. It is the combination of innate talent and acquired skills that truly drives success.

Ps: The wierd thing is that I use an example of Cao but kimi replace it with Jack Ma, what fuck of that?

## Become more dependent or independent?

论点：更加独立。首先是科技的创新，让我们可以足不出户就可以享受各种服务和参加各种活动，比如线上购物、视频会议、远程工作等。这些行为都会让我们变得更加独立。其次，大学生活以及社会工作等需要人们独自面对繁杂事务和处理复杂人际关系等，使得人们不得不变得更加独立。

### Before(me, band 6)

The debate over whether people become more dependent or independent who lived in modern world. In my opinion, modern life drives human being more independent.

There are two primary reasons can demonstrate that. Firstly, the innovation of technology which makes our life more convenient than before. People can use and enjoy variety of services and involve activites without going out, such as shopping online, video conference and remote work. Such innovation of technology gives people a view which is you can do things by yourself instead of with others. Secondly, university life and social work require people to face complex relationships and stuffs independently which makes people more independent. Me, for example, my parents give me more space to develop myself with ease regulation. When I get into university which was far away from my hometown, a strange place and as a stranger, I need to face all of things I do not know and only I can figure it out by myself. After this experience, the thing I learnt is you have to become independently without any mercy.

In conclusion, even though numbers of people agree with moden life makes people become more dependent, I still think that moden life give us a different view to live independently.

After this experience, what I learned is that one must become independent without any mercy.

In conclusion, even though many people agree that modern life makes people more dependent, I still believe that modern life gives us a different perspective on living independently.

## Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions.

论点：不同意这种观点，景点的作用是吸引有志之人前来观赏，顺便宣传该国的文化和历史，以此吸引更多的游客。因此，无论是本地游客还是外国游客，都应该享受同等待遇，而不是仅对外国游客提高收费。如果对外国游客提高收费，那么会减少国外游客的流量，从而无法起到宣传作用。同时，本国游客可能也并不会好好珍惜当下的优惠政策，在景点留下不好的印象。

### Before(me, band 5.5)

Some people think that foreign visitors should pay more than local visitor for those popular spots. Acturally, I don't think this is a good choice.

It is obvious that the meaning of cultural and historical attractions is to attract more people who really like our cultural background propogated by these attractions, and then attract more tourists which from all over the world to come and share these popular cultural spots. Thus, both foreign visitors and local visitors should have same situation instead of increase fees only for foreign visitors.

If goverments increase the fee for foreign visitors, the traffic of foreign visitor will dropped quickly, and then this action cannot make the positive effort, which means the spot cannot propogate our culture and history for those people who really like so. Whereas the profit by this action still bring negative impact. For example, the Sourth Korea goverments aims to make more money in order to increase the fee for foreign visitors, and then become notorous.

In conclusion, I don't think that increase the fee for foreign visitiors can make positive move, instead this measurement will reduce the international impaction. 

### After(Kimi, band 7)

Some people believe that foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for entry to popular tourist spots. However, I disagree with this notion.

It is clear that the purpose of cultural and historical attractions is to attract a diverse audience who appreciate our cultural heritage. These attractions should be accessible to people from all over the world, fostering a shared experience of our popular cultural sites. Therefore, both foreign and local visitors should be treated equally in terms of fees, rather than imposing higher charges on foreign visitors.

If governments were to increase fees for foreign visitors, there would likely be a rapid decline in the number of international tourists. This would not only be counterproductive but could also have negative consequences. For instance, the South Korean government, aiming to increase revenue, raised fees for foreign visitors, which led to a negative reputation.

In conclusion, I do not believe that increasing fees for foreign visitors is a positive move. Instead, such a policy would likely diminish the international appeal of these cultural and historical sites.

### After(Kimi, band 9)

The debate over whether foreign tourists should be charged higher entry fees to popular tourist spots has been a contentious issue. While some argue that it could generate additional revenue for local economies, I firmly believe that this approach is misguided.

Cultural and historical sites are the custodians of our collective heritage, and their role is to educate and inspire a broad spectrum of visitors. By levying higher fees on foreign tourists, we risk alienating the very people who travel great distances to immerse themselves in our culture. Uniform pricing, on the other hand, promotes inclusivity and encourages a global exchange of ideas and mutual respect. It is this spirit of openness that has allowed our cultural landmarks to become ambassadors of our history and traditions.

Moreover, the potential repercussions of such a policy are not trivial. An increase in fees could deter tourists, leading to a significant drop in international visitation. This, in turn, could result in a paradoxical decrease in revenue, as fewer tourists mean fewer opportunities to spend money in the local economy. Furthermore, it could tarnish the reputation of a country as being unwelcoming or mercenary. For example, South Korea's decision to raise fees for foreign visitors to certain attractions was met with widespread criticism and may have deterred some from visiting.

Additionally, it is important to consider the broader implications of such a policy on international relations. Cultural exchange is a cornerstone of diplomacy, and by making our sites more expensive for foreigners, we may inadvertently signal that we value their patronage less. This could lead to a chilling effect on the very cultural exchanges that these sites are meant to facilitate.

In summation, the notion of charging foreign visitors more for cultural and historical attractions is fraught with potential pitfalls. It is not only likely to be counterproductive in terms of revenue but also detrimental to our international standing and cultural diplomacy. Instead, we should strive to make these experiences as accessible as possible, fostering a spirit of global unity and shared appreciation for the richness of our world's cultural heritage.

## Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should goverments give more financial support to local film industries?

### Before(me, band 5)

论点：国外的电影有更好的演员阵容，高质量的电影情节，同时有更酷炫的动作特效以及动画特效。反观国内的电影，很多十八线的不知名演员出演一些剧情狗血的电影，完全没有收视率。而一些相对知名的演员的剧本也没好到哪里去，同时欠缺高质量特效。少部分质量较高的国内电影，因为宣传力度等原因，往往缺少同好莱坞电影一较高下的机会。如果能有政府的资金支持，相信国内的电影水平也会大幅提升，从而提升国内演员的知名度，激励更多更优质的制作者以及电影创作者“抛头露面”。

It is true that the oversea films are more attractive than domestic produced films. There could be several factors why this is the case, and that would be helpful if goverments give more financial support to local film industries.

There are numbers of reason numerous people prefer to watch oversea films instead of locally produced films. First of all, there are fantastic actor groups in foreign films which have highly quality film secnerios, and also have cooler special effect of action and animation. The Dune, for example, which produced by famous producer in the world and those actors whose act in film are also famous too. By contrast, those domestic produced films produced by nobody with slothful stories and act by unfamous actors, which have inferier viewed on the cenima. Even though those famous actors' film also lack marvlous stories.

In my opinion, it's helpful if goverments give more financial support to local film indestries instead of ignore it. Most of locally produced films don't have good stories and special effect. Additonally, the produce maker don't have enough money to made it happen. To do this, produce maker could employs more famous actors and high level producers to make incredible films. For example, the film Upgrade was supported by locally goverments and then got high viewed.

Broadly speaking, I believe that financial support will take an effect on those issues which were affect locally film industries developemnt.

### After(kimi, band 7)

It is indeed true that films from overseas often appear more captivating than those produced domestically. There are several factors contributing to this perception, and addressing these issues through increased government financial support could be highly beneficial.

A multitude of reasons underpin the preference for foreign films over domestic ones. Firstly, foreign films typically boast exceptional casts and high-quality cinematic scenarios, as well as stunning special effects in action and animation genres. For instance, "Dune" was produced by a renowned producer and featured well-known actors, which significantly contributed to its success. In contrast, domestic films are often produced by lesser-known individuals with uninspiring stories and feature less famous actors, leading to subpar viewing experiences in theaters. Even films with famous actors can suffer from lackluster storylines.

In my opinion, it would be immensely advantageous for governments to provide increased financial support to local film industries rather than neglecting them. Many locally produced films are hampered by a lack of compelling narratives and special effects. Moreover, producers often lack the necessary funds to realize their creative visions. To remedy this, producers could hire more renowned actors and high-caliber directors to create exceptional films. For example, the film "Upgrade" received local government support and subsequently enjoyed considerable viewership.

Broadly speaking, I believe that financial support can effectively address issues affecting the development of local film industries. By investing in storytelling and production quality, domestic films can compete more effectively with their overseas counterparts.
