## Become more dependent or independent?

论点：更加独立。首先是科技的创新，让我们可以足不出户就可以享受各种服务和参加各种活动，比如线上购物、视频会议、远程工作等。这些行为都会让我们变得更加独立。其次，大学生活以及社会工作等需要人们独自面对繁杂事务和处理复杂人际关系等，使得人们不得不变得更加独立。

### Before(me, band 6)

The debate over whether people become more dependent or independent who lived in modern world. In my opinion, modern life drives human being more independent.

There are two primary reasons can demonstrate that. Firstly, the innovation of technology which makes our life more convenient than before. People can use and enjoy variety of services and involve activites without going out, such as shopping online, video conference and remote work. Such innovation of technology gives people a view which is you can do things by yourself instead of with others. Secondly, university life and social work require people to face complex relationships and stuffs independently which makes people more independent. Me, for example, my parents give me more space to develop myself with ease regulation. When I get into university which was far away from my hometown, a strange place and as a stranger, I need to face all of things I do not know and only I can figure it out by myself. After this experience, the thing I learnt is you have to become independently without any mercy.

In conclusion, even though numbers of people agree with moden life makes people become more dependent, I still think that moden life give us a different view to live independently.

The debate over whether people become more dependent or independent in the modern world is ongoing. In my opinion, modern life encourages humans to be more independent.

There are two primary reasons that demonstrate this. Firstly, technological innovations have made our lives more convenient than ever before. People can use and enjoy a variety of services and activities without going out, such as online shopping, video conferencing, and remote work. These innovations give people the view that they can do things by themselves instead of relying on others. Secondly, university life and social work require people to face complex situations independently, which fosters independence. For example, my parents gave me more space to develop myself with minimal guidance. When I entered a university far away from my hometown, I found myself in a strange place as a stranger, needing to face all the unknowns and figure them out by myself. After this experience, what I learned is that one must become independent without any mercy.

In conclusion, even though many people agree that modern life makes people more dependent, I still believe that modern life gives us a different perspective on living independently.

## Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions.

论点：不同意这种观点，景点的作用是吸引有志之人前来观赏，顺便宣传该国的文化和历史，以此吸引更多的游客。因此，无论是本地游客还是外国游客，都应该享受同等待遇，而不是仅对外国游客提高收费。如果对外国游客提高收费，那么会减少国外游客的流量，从而无法起到宣传作用。同时，本国游客可能也并不会好好珍惜当下的优惠政策，在景点留下不好的印象。

### Before(me, band 5.5)

Some people think that foreign visitors should pay more than local visitor for those popular spots. Acturally, I don't think this is a good choice.

It is obvious that the meaning of cultural and historical attractions is to attract more people who really like our cultural background propogated by these attractions, and then attract more tourists which from all over the world to come and share these popular cultural spots. Thus, both foreign visitors and local visitors should have same situation instead of increase fees only for foreign visitors.

If goverments increase the fee for foreign visitors, the traffic of foreign visitor will dropped quickly, and then this action cannot make the positive effort, which means the spot cannot propogate our culture and history for those people who really like so. Whereas the profit by this action still bring negative impact. For example, the Sourth Korea goverments aims to make more money in order to increase the fee for foreign visitors, and then become notorous.

In conclusion, I don't think that increase the fee for foreign visitiors can make positive move, instead this measurement will reduce the international impaction. 

### After(Kimi, band 7)

Some people believe that foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for entry to popular tourist spots. However, I disagree with this notion.

It is clear that the purpose of cultural and historical attractions is to attract a diverse audience who appreciate our cultural heritage. These attractions should be accessible to people from all over the world, fostering a shared experience of our popular cultural sites. Therefore, both foreign and local visitors should be treated equally in terms of fees, rather than imposing higher charges on foreign visitors.

If governments were to increase fees for foreign visitors, there would likely be a rapid decline in the number of international tourists. This would not only be counterproductive but could also have negative consequences. For instance, the South Korean government, aiming to increase revenue, raised fees for foreign visitors, which led to a negative reputation.

In conclusion, I do not believe that increasing fees for foreign visitors is a positive move. Instead, such a policy would likely diminish the international appeal of these cultural and historical sites.

### After(Kimi, band 9)

The debate over whether foreign tourists should be charged higher entry fees to popular tourist spots has been a contentious issue. While some argue that it could generate additional revenue for local economies, I firmly believe that this approach is misguided.

Cultural and historical sites are the custodians of our collective heritage, and their role is to educate and inspire a broad spectrum of visitors. By levying higher fees on foreign tourists, we risk alienating the very people who travel great distances to immerse themselves in our culture. Uniform pricing, on the other hand, promotes inclusivity and encourages a global exchange of ideas and mutual respect. It is this spirit of openness that has allowed our cultural landmarks to become ambassadors of our history and traditions.

Moreover, the potential repercussions of such a policy are not trivial. An increase in fees could deter tourists, leading to a significant drop in international visitation. This, in turn, could result in a paradoxical decrease in revenue, as fewer tourists mean fewer opportunities to spend money in the local economy. Furthermore, it could tarnish the reputation of a country as being unwelcoming or mercenary. For example, South Korea's decision to raise fees for foreign visitors to certain attractions was met with widespread criticism and may have deterred some from visiting.

Additionally, it is important to consider the broader implications of such a policy on international relations. Cultural exchange is a cornerstone of diplomacy, and by making our sites more expensive for foreigners, we may inadvertently signal that we value their patronage less. This could lead to a chilling effect on the very cultural exchanges that these sites are meant to facilitate.

In summation, the notion of charging foreign visitors more for cultural and historical attractions is fraught with potential pitfalls. It is not only likely to be counterproductive in terms of revenue but also detrimental to our international standing and cultural diplomacy. Instead, we should strive to make these experiences as accessible as possible, fostering a spirit of global unity and shared appreciation for the richness of our world's cultural heritage.

## Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should goverments give more financial support to local film industries?

### Before(me, band 5)

论点：国外的电影有更好的演员阵容，高质量的电影情节，同时有更酷炫的动作特效以及动画特效。反观国内的电影，很多十八线的不知名演员出演一些剧情狗血的电影，完全没有收视率。而一些相对知名的演员的剧本也没好到哪里去，同时欠缺高质量特效。少部分质量较高的国内电影，因为宣传力度等原因，往往缺少同好莱坞电影一较高下的机会。如果能有政府的资金支持，相信国内的电影水平也会大幅提升，从而提升国内演员的知名度，激励更多更优质的制作者以及电影创作者“抛头露面”。

It is true that the oversea films are more attractive than domestic produced films. There could be several factors why this is the case, and that would be helpful if goverments give more financial support to local film industries.

There are numbers of reason numerous people prefer to watch oversea films instead of locally produced films. First of all, there are fantastic actor groups in foreign films which have highly quality film secnerios, and also have cooler special effect of action and animation. The Dune, for example, which produced by famous producer in the world and those actors whose act in film are also famous too. By contrast, those domestic produced films produced by nobody with slothful stories and act by unfamous actors, which have inferier viewed on the cenima. Even though those famous actors' film also lack marvlous stories.

In my opinion, it's helpful if goverments give more financial support to local film indestries instead of ignore it. Most of locally produced films don't have good stories and special effect. Additonally, the produce maker don't have enough money to made it happen. To do this, produce maker could employs more famous actors and high level producers to make incredible films. For example, the film Upgrade was supported by locally goverments and then got high viewed.

Broadly speaking, I believe that financial support will take an effect on those issues which were affect locally film industries developemnt.

### After(kimi, band 7)

It is indeed true that films from overseas often appear more captivating than those produced domestically. There are several factors contributing to this perception, and addressing these issues through increased government financial support could be highly beneficial.

A multitude of reasons underpin the preference for foreign films over domestic ones. Firstly, foreign films typically boast exceptional casts and high-quality cinematic scenarios, as well as stunning special effects in action and animation genres. For instance, "Dune" was produced by a renowned producer and featured well-known actors, which significantly contributed to its success. In contrast, domestic films are often produced by lesser-known individuals with uninspiring stories and feature less famous actors, leading to subpar viewing experiences in theaters. Even films with famous actors can suffer from lackluster storylines.

In my opinion, it would be immensely advantageous for governments to provide increased financial support to local film industries rather than neglecting them. Many locally produced films are hampered by a lack of compelling narratives and special effects. Moreover, producers often lack the necessary funds to realize their creative visions. To remedy this, producers could hire more renowned actors and high-caliber directors to create exceptional films. For example, the film "Upgrade" received local government support and subsequently enjoyed considerable viewership.

Broadly speaking, I believe that financial support can effectively address issues affecting the development of local film industries. By investing in storytelling and production quality, domestic films can compete more effectively with their overseas counterparts.
