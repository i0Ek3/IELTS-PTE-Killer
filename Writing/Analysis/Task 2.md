## Should we only concerned our own country?

论点1：远水解不了近渴，我们应该更多的关注和维护我们周围的社区。个人的力量是渺小的，尤其是对于国际来说。但是我们可以关注发生在我们周围的事情。比如，在社区医院做志愿者，帮助护士更好的照顾需要照看的病人。在社区服务站，为老年人提供问答帮助。这些行为不但可以提高社区的影响力，也可以为社会做出贡献，合理分配资源。

论点2：如果眼前有需要帮助的人或事，我们却没有伸出援助之手，反而去帮助其他国家需要帮助的人，虽然帮助本身没有对错，但是有点本末倒置了。世界上有很多需要帮助的地区和人，如何划分优先级以及如何分配应急资源，这都是一个较大的挑战。如果没有全面考虑本国的情况，不切实际的面对问题，这本身是不理智的。

There is an ongoing debate about whether people should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. In fact, I am firmly believe that we should pay more attention on our surrounding situations with higher priorities, insteading pay more attention on others with unintenlegence.

There is an adage about far away water cannot solve present thirsty, which means we should pay more attention on and mainten our communities. The truth is that personal power the far away lower than countries, in particular to the international. However, we can take some measures to overcome the issues our communities faced presently. For example, people can do some convenient stuffs to take care needed people as vounlteer, and young people can offer some question-answer helps for elderly. By doing this, which can promote the positive effect to this society, and also save our social resources.

On the contary, if we ignorance the needed stuffs and people from nearly, but give a favor to those country who need help, even though itself was not false, it reversed primary and second too much. There are many countries and people need help on this world, it still is a tremendous challenge on how to divide priority and distribute resource. By disconsidering this fully, it is an unrealistic.

In conclusion, I do believe that we should pay more attention on our own communities instead ignore realistic problems to help others.     

### After(kimi, band 8)

There is an ongoing debate about whether people should focus solely on their own communities and countries. In my opinion, we should prioritize our immediate surroundings and give them more attention than distant issues, which may not be within our sphere of influence.

There is an adage that states, "Far away water cannot quench near thirst," implying that we should prioritize our local communities. The truth is that the impact of individual efforts is more significant within one's own country, particularly in the international context. However, we can take measures to address the issues our communities face. For example, people can engage in simple acts of kindness to support those in need, such as volunteering, and young individuals can offer assistance to the elderly by answering questions and providing companionship. These actions promote a positive effect on society and conserve social resources.

Conversely, neglecting the immediate needs and focusing on distant countries, even with good intentions, can lead to a reversal of priorities. There are numerous countries and people in need globally, and determining how to allocate resources is a significant challenge. Ignoring this reality is unrealistic.

In conclusion, I believe that we should concentrate on our own communities and not ignore pressing local issues in favor of assisting others who are beyond our immediate reach.

## Reasons and measures of average life increasing.

### After(kimi, band 9)

The average human lifespan has been on the rise, a trend that has profound implications for both individuals and society at large. I firmly believe that there are some measures to address the challenges posed by an aging population.

The primary reasons for the increase in average lifespan can be attributed to advancements in medical technology and improved healthcare systems. For individuals, a longer lifespan presents challenges such as the need for longer-term financial planning for retirement and the potential for increased health issues in old age. The psychological impact of living longer should not be overlooked, as individuals may experience a sense of purposelessness or anxiety about the future. Societally, the increase in average lifespan has led to an aging population, which puts pressure on social security systems and healthcare resources. The workforce may also be affected, as an aging population could lead to a shrinking labor force and increased dependency ratios. This demographic shift necessitates a reevaluation of retirement policies and healthcare provisions.

To address these challenges, governments and societies must take proactive measures. This includes reforming pension systems to ensure sustainability, investing in healthcare infrastructure to accommodate the needs of an aging population, and promoting active aging through community programs and lifelong learning opportunities. Encouraging healthy lifestyles and preventive healthcare can also reduce the burden of chronic diseases. Additionally, fostering intergenerational cooperation and valuing the contributions of older adults can help create a more inclusive and supportive society.

In conclusion, the increase in average lifespan is a testament to human progress, but it also presents significant challenges. 

## Video games are as a good or bad tools?

我并不认为游戏的弊端大于好处，相反我认为游戏的好处大于其弊端。

论点1：游戏的设计初衷是为了让玩家放松享受的，同时游戏厂商让玩家花费一些时间和金钱来维持游戏的可持续性。玩家既享受了游戏带来的乐趣，也为经济做出了贡献，实则双赢。比如，当我结束一天繁忙的工作后，打开游戏玩上一局，整个人都感觉很放松，元气满满。这也有助于我的健康。

论点2：游戏有助于开发人类大脑功能。大部分游戏是需要脑力运算的，这就需要玩家根据对应的游戏场景调动脑功能来想出对应的策略来完成游戏任务。那些高难度的关卡需要玩家集中精力且想出更加可行的办法才能通关，这对大脑的开发大有裨益。比如那些策略类游戏，我需要思考在哪里建造城堡以及护城河，如何抵御外敌入侵，这些都需要大脑思考的。

### Before(me, band 5.5)

There is an ongoing debate on whether video games play a positive role or a negative role in nowadays. In my opinion, the benefits of video games are more important than the drwabacks.

On the one hand, video games make me feel relax. In fact, vendors design the games used to relax for players, and also used to promote economical values, which can maintain the games' sustainable. Players enjoy that moment also make contribution to our economic, which are dual-win. For example, after busy work off, I would like play a round for video game, which make me feel refreshed and delightful.

On the other hand, video games are helpful to develop our brain functions. There is no doubt that brain consuming in the most of video games are always needed, which means players need to find a available solution to solve these tough problems in games. Those high-level game rounds require players pay more attention and focus on interactive strategies, which used to develop our brain functions. For those strategy games, for instance, we should determine where should we build our protected river and how to defense aliens.

In conclusion, video games are helpful to our moods and brain function developing, and I do not think that the drawbacks of video games outweight the benefits.

###  After(kimi, band 7)

There is an ongoing debate about whether video games play a positive or negative role in modern society. In my opinion, the benefits of video games outweigh the drawbacks.

On one hand, video games provide relaxation and stress relief. Game developers design games with the intention of providing a relaxing experience for players, while also promoting economic value, ensuring the sustainability of the gaming industry. Players enjoy these games and simultaneously contribute to the economy, creating a win-win situation. For instance, after a busy day at work, I find playing a round of a video game to be refreshing and delightful.

On the other hand, video games are beneficial for developing brain functions. There is no doubt that most video games require cognitive effort, which means players need to find viable solutions to in-game challenges. High-level game rounds demand increased attention and focus on interactive strategies, which are essential for developing brain functions. Strategy games, for example, require us to determine where to build protective barriers and how to defend against alien invasions.

In conclusion, video games are beneficial to our moods and the development of brain functions. I do not believe that the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits.

## Why do we need music? Is the traditional music more important than the international music?

为什么重要：1 音乐是一种文化输出，是链接世界各地人民的桥梁。通过音乐，大家可以互相学习了解各自的文化。2 音乐是日常生活的投影，更是我们生活中的灵感体现。你可以在音乐中听到关于生活的细节，还能听到歌手对生活的态度。3 音乐是传达信息的一种工具和载体，是我们表达想法的途径。同时音乐也是我们放松的方式，对我们的负面情绪有积极的作用。

传统音乐是否更重要：首先我并不认为传统音乐比国际音乐就更重要，反之亦然。音乐不分国界，更不分流派重要性。无论是传统音乐还是国际音乐，都有其不可替代的一面。传统音乐作为一个国家的传统文化的积淀，保留了历史进程中的文化信息，有着积极推进文化潮流的作用，我们应时刻牢记。如我们的国歌，它就记录了我们国家艰难成立的过程，有着警示作用。而国际音乐是更为先进、潮流的体现，尤其是年轻一代的精神支柱，为这个世界带来更多的可能性。如欧美歌手 Adele 的音乐，她的音乐真的可以治愈人们的心灵。因此，两种类型的音乐都很重要。

### Before(me, band 5.5)

There are many types of music in these world, which are intergrated people's intellegent and emotion. Morever, music play an significant role in our human beings' life. And I truely think that there are equal importance between traditional music and international music.

As a kind of cultural output, music linked people among the world. Through the music, people can learning different cultures from all over the world. Music also are projection of our daily life, and as a spiratual guide too. You can find more details and atitudes of singers' life through the music, you can feel the air in that moment. At the same time, music is a tool and a carrier to convey information, which also is an approach to express our thought. Of course, music is a relaxation way which is helpful to dimish our negative moods.

On the other hand, I do not think that the traditional music more important than the international music, versa vice. Firstly, there is no country boundries among the music, neither music genre. In fact, there are unplaceable aspects between the traditional music and the international music. Traditional music as a sediment of one country's traditional culture which preserves the primary information in its historical process, and it can propel the cultural style to a new milestone which we should memorize it forever. Our national song, for example, it recorded the built up process of our country, which have alert feature. Whereas the international music, which intergrated more advanced and fashionable style and bring this world more possibilities, as a spirit backup to our young people. Such as Adele's music, her music really touching people's inner world.   

In conclusion, music have significant effects to our life, and I do not think that the traditional music take more importance to the international music. On the contary, they are equal importance to our life.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There are myriad types of music in this world, which integrate people's intelligence and emotions. Moreover, music plays a significant role in human life. I firmly believe that there is equal importance between traditional music and international music.

As a form of cultural expression, music connects people across the globe. Through music, we can learn about different cultures from around the world. Music also reflects our daily lives and serves as a spiritual guide. You can discover more details and attitudes about the singers' lives through their music, feeling the atmosphere of the times in which they were created. At the same time, music is a tool and a carrier to convey information, and it is also a means to express our thoughts. Of course, music is also a relaxing way to help diminish our negative moods.

On the other hand, I do not think that traditional music is more important than international music, nor vice versa. There are no national boundaries in music, nor are there strict genre boundaries. In fact, there are innumerable aspects that bridge the gap between traditional music and international music. Traditional music, as a sediment of a country's cultural heritage, preserves the essence of its history, and it can propel cultural styles to new heights, which we should remember forever. Our national anthems, for example, record the historical development of our countries and have an alert feature. In contrast, international music, which integrates more advanced and fashionable styles, brings more possibilities to the world, providing spiritual support to our youth. Adele's music, for instance, truly touches people's inner worlds.

In conclusion, music has significant effects on our lives, and I do not believe that traditional music holds more importance than international music. On the contrary, they are equally important to our lives.

## Teenagers should be required to do unpaid work to community?

青少年不应该无薪为社区工作。

论点1：青少年的主要任务应该是继续完成学业，而不是花更多的时间在社区工作。等他们毕业了，有的是时间工作，现在就把中心放到工作上，会让他们日后的可选择性大大降低。想象一下，一个高中没有毕业的学生，在社会上会找到一个什么样的工作，从而能够养家糊口呢？

论点2：青少年如果免费为社区工作，会滋生一些不必要的资源浪费。那些雇主可能会不珍惜这样的资源，反而存在白嫖行为。另一方面，青少年既无法很好的锻炼技能，也无法更好得到应有的报酬，会让他们对这样的工作产生落差，从而影响日后的工作。

### Before(me, band 6)

There is an ongoing debate whether teenagers should be required to do some unpaid work to commuity. However, I do not think that unpaid work to community can bring more benefit for teenagers.

Firstly, finishing study is a mainly task for teenagers instead of pay more attention on community unpaid work. After they are graduated from high school, there are more choices for them to take works. If they are turned core into work, there would be less possibilities for work selection in the future. By doing this, one is not graduated from high school without any skills and knowledge, what job would they get easily and hold family well-lived?

Secondly, there would be more resources wasted by teenages doing unpaid work to community. It is obvious that employers cannot perish these resources which are free for them. Moreover, the employer will do something bad on these teenagers, for example, let them work overtime or do something which are they should not do. On the other hand, unpaid work make teenagers feel utilized by these people and they cannot get positive feedback, and cannot learn any useful skills. In fact, all of these behaviour will take neagtive impact to them when they need to decide which work they are really like and dive into.

In conclusion, I do not think that teenagers do these unpaid work to community can bring positive impact. By contrast, I do think that teenagers should finish their study work first.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is an ongoing debate about whether teenagers should be required to participate in unpaid community service. However, I believe that mandatory unpaid work may not be the most beneficial use of a teenager's time.

Firstly, the primary task for teenagers should be to focus on their studies rather than diverting their attention to unpaid community work. Once they graduate from high school, they will have a wider array of career options available to them. If they become too focused on work, there may be fewer opportunities for them to explore different career paths in the future. Without a high school diploma and marketable skills, what kind of job would they easily obtain and how could they hope to support themselves and their families?

Secondly, there is a potential waste of resources when teenagers engage in unpaid work. It is clear that employers might not value or manage resources as carefully when the labor is provided for free. Furthermore, employers might exploit these young workers, for instance, by making them work overtime or assigning them tasks that are inappropriate or unsafe. On the other hand, unpaid work might lead teenagers to feel undervalued and exploited, without receiving positive feedback or learning useful skills. In fact, these negative experiences could have a detrimental impact on their future career choices and work ethic.

In conclusion, I do not believe that mandatory unpaid community work would have a positive impact on teenagers. On the contrary, I think teenagers should prioritize their education first.

## Government should give finnancial support to creative artists?

论点1：应该。但是资助不是无条件的，可以通过评估其作品质量进行资助，以激励他们更好地发挥才能，为这个社会的文化艺术气息增添光彩。同时应无条件为那些较为穷困且有艺术追求的艺术家进行资助，以帮助他们更好地度过困难时期。

论点1：不应该。各行各业都有各自的竞争力，如果资助了艺术创作，那么其他领域也会寻求资助，但是对于政府来说这是不小的压力。因此，可以对少部分高质量的以及有很好的社会贡献力的艺术创作进行资助。

### Before(me, band 6)

There is an ongoing debate whether government should give finnancial support to creative artists. In my opinion, finnancial support shouldn't be an unconditional incentive, which means government should give limited finnancial support to those who give this society tremendous impact.

On the one hand, finnacial support shouldn't be an unconditional behavior. The government should give finnacial support to those creative artists who did high-level artworks in order that sitimulate them to release creative talents, which can bring cultural and art astomersphere for this society. Meanwhile, the government should give finnacial support unconditionally to those artists who have high demanding to art, which can help them to overcome that tough moment.

On the other hand, the government shouldn't give finnacial support to creative artists. Because of there are much fierce competitions between the artist. If government support those artists and there should be other people asking for support either, which is a huge press to government.

In conclusion, I do not believe that government should give finnacial support to artists unconditionally, insteading government should give limited finnacial support to those people who have positive impact to this society.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is an ongoing debate about whether the government should provide financial support to creative artists. In my opinion, financial support should not be unconditional; instead, it should be offered selectively to those artists who make a substantial impact on society. 

On the one hand, financial support should be targeted. The government should offer financial support to artists who produce high-quality work, in order to stimulate their creativity and foster a rich cultural and artistic atmosphere in society. For instance, unconditional support could be given to artists with a profound dedication to their craft, helping them through difficult times. 

On the other hand, some argue that the government should not provide financial support to artists. They point out the intense competition among artists; if the government supports some, others will also demand support, placing a significant burden on the government. 

In conclusion, I do not believe that the government should offer financial support to artists unconditionally. Instead, the government should provide limited, targeted financial support to those individuals whose work positively impacts society.

### After(Claude, band 8)

There is an ongoing debate about whether governments should provide financial support to creative artists. In my opinion, while such support can be beneficial, it should not be offered unconditionally. Instead, I believe that governments should provide limited financial assistance to those artists who make significant contributions to society.

Firstly, financial support should be granted judiciously and based on merit. Governments should allocate funds to artists who consistently produce high-quality work, as this approach can stimulate their creativity and encourage them to further develop their talents. This, in turn, can enrich the cultural and artistic atmosphere of society. For instance, providing grants to promising young painters or musicians can enable them to focus on their craft, potentially leading to groundbreaking artworks or compositions that elevate the nation's cultural standing. Additionally, established artists facing temporary financial hardships could receive support to help them overcome challenging periods, ensuring that valuable artistic voices are not lost due to economic pressures.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of government funding for the arts. The art world is highly competitive, and providing financial support to some artists may create a sense of inequality or favoritism. This could lead to resentment among those who do not receive funding and potentially stifle the natural evolution of artistic movements. Moreover, if the government becomes too involved in funding the arts, there is a risk of influencing artistic expression, potentially compromising the independence and authenticity of creative works. For example, artists might be tempted to conform to government preferences to secure funding, rather than pursuing their true artistic vision.

To strike a balance, I propose that governments implement a transparent and merit-based system for allocating financial support to artists. This system should consider factors such as the artist's track record, the potential societal impact of their work, and their financial need. Furthermore, the support should be time-limited and subject to regular review, ensuring that funds are used effectively and that a diverse range of artists can benefit over time.

In conclusion, while I do not advocate for unconditional financial support for all artists, I believe that a carefully managed system of limited government funding can play a crucial role in nurturing artistic talent and enriching our cultural landscape. By supporting those who demonstrate exceptional skill and potential to positively impact society, governments can foster a thriving artistic community without unduly influencing the natural development of creative expression.

## Should ban testing on animals?

论点1：不该禁止。从人类整体的福祉考虑，动物实验可以测试新药以及治疗绝症，可以为人类以及其他动物带来新的机遇。此外，有些动物的基因和人类很相似，可以更好地进行测试，从而将研究成果应用到人类身上。因此在没有找到其他可以测试研究的方案之前，不应禁止动物实验。

论点2：应该禁止。动物也是有感情的，它们可以理解当下环境的情况。用动物做实验会导致动物本身的痛苦，以及影响生态平衡，降低动物种族的数量。

### Before(me, band 6)

There is an argument on whether ban testing on animals among the people. In my opinion, we can use animals to test state-of-art researches in a limited situation.

Considerably, we shouldn't ban testing on animals, because of some animals can be used to testing new drugs and do novelty researches, which is helpful to understand and heal human beings themselves. Therefore, we should use limited numbers of animal before finding a new solution which can be used to testing drugs. 

Counterpartly, animal testing should be banned under the moral framework and balanced ecosystem. It is true that animals also have feelings and emotions. They can feel the pain and understand the situations under the different astomespheres. Additionally, animals testing will reduce the number of it's flocks, and also impact the balance of ecosystem.

Broadly speaking, I do not think that ban testing on animals can solve basic problems of our human beings faced in a long way.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is an ongoing debate on whether animal testing should be banned. In my opinion, animals can be used for testing cutting-edge research in a limited set of circumstances.

On the one hand, we shouldn't ban animal testing because some animals can be used to test new drugs and conduct novel research, which can help us understand and treat human ailments. Therefore, we should use a limited number of animals for testing until we find an alternative solution.

On the other hand, animal testing should be banned under the moral framework and for the sake of ecological balance. It is true that animals also have feelings and emotions. They can feel pain and understand their environments. Additionally, animal testing can reduce populations and impact the balance of ecosystems.

In conclusion, I do not believe that banning animal testing would address the fundamental issues our species faces in the long term. Instead, we should seek alternatives while recognizing the necessity in specific, limited situations.

## Born with certain talents or can be taught?

### Before(me, band 6)

There is a firce debate whether the talent is born with or can be teach. However, it really depends. In some fields, for example, mathmatical and physical, people were required certain talents which is born with. And in other fields such as psycology, you can be a talent by teaching.

There are serveral fields need people born with talents. For example, mathmatical, physical and algorithm are also requires highly logical ability. As an example, Alstein is a famous and talent physist who was proposed the relative theory which is sophisicated physical theory and applied broadly. This is a breaking inovation of this world. However, if there is no such people like Alstein, our world still may remain on primitive stage.

There is also are opportunities for those people who bornt normally. The true that most of people are under this range. For example, for now, Cao is a famous singer who write songs for  those super stars. But before that, you may even don't know him or never heard of him. He is really like sing songs and want be a singer. However, there is no music producer want sign him, but he never give up and he practice sing ability harder more than ever. And one day, his song just on the top, he just made it happen.

In conculsion, those fields which are required strong logical exactly need people born with talents. By contrast, those fields which are required emotional needs can be taugh.

### After(kimi, band 7)

There is a fierce debate over whether talent is innate or can be taught. However, it really depends. In some fields, for example, mathematics and physics, people require certain innate talents. And in other fields such as psychology, one can become talented through teaching.

There are several fields that need individuals born with talent. For example, in mathematics, physics, and algorithm design, highly logical abilities are required. As an example, Einstein was a famous and talented physicist who proposed the theory of relativity, a sophisticated physical theory that is widely applied. This was a groundbreaking innovation for our world. However, without individuals like Einstein, our world might still be at a primitive stage.

There are also opportunities for those born with ordinary abilities. The truth is that most people fall into this range. For example, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was not an overnight success. He faced many rejections and failures before he became one of the most successful businessmen in the world. His story shows that with perseverance and hard work, one can achieve great things even without exceptional innate talent.

In conclusion, fields that require strong logical abilities do need individuals born with talent. By contrast, fields that require emotional intelligence can be taught. It is the combination of innate talent and acquired skills that truly drives success.

Ps: The wierd thing is that I use an example of Cao but kimi replace it with Jack Ma, what fuck of that?

## Become more dependent or independent?

论点：更加独立。首先是科技的创新，让我们可以足不出户就可以享受各种服务和参加各种活动，比如线上购物、视频会议、远程工作等。这些行为都会让我们变得更加独立。其次，大学生活以及社会工作等需要人们独自面对繁杂事务和处理复杂人际关系等，使得人们不得不变得更加独立。

### Before(me, band 6)

The debate over whether people become more dependent or independent who lived in modern world. In my opinion, modern life drives human being more independent.

There are two primary reasons can demonstrate that. Firstly, the innovation of technology which makes our life more convenient than before. People can use and enjoy variety of services and involve activites without going out, such as shopping online, video conference and remote work. Such innovation of technology gives people a view which is you can do things by yourself instead of with others. Secondly, university life and social work require people to face complex relationships and stuffs independently which makes people more independent. Me, for example, my parents give me more space to develop myself with ease regulation. When I get into university which was far away from my hometown, a strange place and as a stranger, I need to face all of things I do not know and only I can figure it out by myself. After this experience, the thing I learnt is you have to become independently without any mercy.

In conclusion, even though numbers of people agree with moden life makes people become more dependent, I still think that moden life give us a different view to live independently.

### After(Kimi, band 7)

The debate over whether people become more dependent or independent in the modern world is ongoing. In my opinion, modern life encourages humans to be more independent.

There are two primary reasons that demonstrate this. Firstly, technological innovations have made our lives more convenient than ever before. People can use and enjoy a variety of services and activities without going out, such as online shopping, video conferencing, and remote work. These innovations give people the view that they can do things by themselves instead of relying on others. Secondly, university life and social work require people to face complex situations independently, which fosters independence. For example, my parents gave me more space to develop myself with minimal guidance. When I entered a university far away from my hometown, I found myself in a strange place as a stranger, needing to face all the unknowns and figure them out by myself. After this experience, what I learned is that one must become independent without any mercy.

In conclusion, even though many people agree that modern life makes people more dependent, I still believe that modern life gives us a different perspective on living independently.

## Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions.

论点：不同意这种观点，景点的作用是吸引有志之人前来观赏，顺便宣传该国的文化和历史，以此吸引更多的游客。因此，无论是本地游客还是外国游客，都应该享受同等待遇，而不是仅对外国游客提高收费。如果对外国游客提高收费，那么会减少国外游客的流量，从而无法起到宣传作用。同时，本国游客可能也并不会好好珍惜当下的优惠政策，在景点留下不好的印象。

### Before(me, band 5.5)

Some people think that foreign visitors should pay more than local visitor for those popular spots. Acturally, I don't think this is a good choice.

It is obvious that the meaning of cultural and historical attractions is to attract more people who really like our cultural background propogated by these attractions, and then attract more tourists which from all over the world to come and share these popular cultural spots. Thus, both foreign visitors and local visitors should have same situation instead of increase fees only for foreign visitors.

If goverments increase the fee for foreign visitors, the traffic of foreign visitor will dropped quickly, and then this action cannot make the positive effort, which means the spot cannot propogate our culture and history for those people who really like so. Whereas the profit by this action still bring negative impact. For example, the Sourth Korea goverments aims to make more money in order to increase the fee for foreign visitors, and then become notorous.

In conclusion, I don't think that increase the fee for foreign visitiors can make positive move, instead this measurement will reduce the international impaction. 

### After(Kimi, band 7)

Some people believe that foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for entry to popular tourist spots. However, I disagree with this notion.

It is clear that the purpose of cultural and historical attractions is to attract a diverse audience who appreciate our cultural heritage. These attractions should be accessible to people from all over the world, fostering a shared experience of our popular cultural sites. Therefore, both foreign and local visitors should be treated equally in terms of fees, rather than imposing higher charges on foreign visitors.

If governments were to increase fees for foreign visitors, there would likely be a rapid decline in the number of international tourists. This would not only be counterproductive but could also have negative consequences. For instance, the South Korean government, aiming to increase revenue, raised fees for foreign visitors, which led to a negative reputation.

In conclusion, I do not believe that increasing fees for foreign visitors is a positive move. Instead, such a policy would likely diminish the international appeal of these cultural and historical sites.

### After(Kimi, band 9)

The debate over whether foreign tourists should be charged higher entry fees to popular tourist spots has been a contentious issue. While some argue that it could generate additional revenue for local economies, I firmly believe that this approach is misguided.

Cultural and historical sites are the custodians of our collective heritage, and their role is to educate and inspire a broad spectrum of visitors. By levying higher fees on foreign tourists, we risk alienating the very people who travel great distances to immerse themselves in our culture. Uniform pricing, on the other hand, promotes inclusivity and encourages a global exchange of ideas and mutual respect. It is this spirit of openness that has allowed our cultural landmarks to become ambassadors of our history and traditions.

Moreover, the potential repercussions of such a policy are not trivial. An increase in fees could deter tourists, leading to a significant drop in international visitation. This, in turn, could result in a paradoxical decrease in revenue, as fewer tourists mean fewer opportunities to spend money in the local economy. Furthermore, it could tarnish the reputation of a country as being unwelcoming or mercenary. For example, South Korea's decision to raise fees for foreign visitors to certain attractions was met with widespread criticism and may have deterred some from visiting.

Additionally, it is important to consider the broader implications of such a policy on international relations. Cultural exchange is a cornerstone of diplomacy, and by making our sites more expensive for foreigners, we may inadvertently signal that we value their patronage less. This could lead to a chilling effect on the very cultural exchanges that these sites are meant to facilitate.

In summation, the notion of charging foreign visitors more for cultural and historical attractions is fraught with potential pitfalls. It is not only likely to be counterproductive in terms of revenue but also detrimental to our international standing and cultural diplomacy. Instead, we should strive to make these experiences as accessible as possible, fostering a spirit of global unity and shared appreciation for the richness of our world's cultural heritage.

## Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should goverments give more financial support to local film industries?

### Before(me, band 5)

论点：国外的电影有更好的演员阵容，高质量的电影情节，同时有更酷炫的动作特效以及动画特效。反观国内的电影，很多十八线的不知名演员出演一些剧情狗血的电影，完全没有收视率。而一些相对知名的演员的剧本也没好到哪里去，同时欠缺高质量特效。少部分质量较高的国内电影，因为宣传力度等原因，往往缺少同好莱坞电影一较高下的机会。如果能有政府的资金支持，相信国内的电影水平也会大幅提升，从而提升国内演员的知名度，激励更多更优质的制作者以及电影创作者“抛头露面”。

It is true that the oversea films are more attractive than domestic produced films. There could be several factors why this is the case, and that would be helpful if goverments give more financial support to local film industries.

There are numbers of reason numerous people prefer to watch oversea films instead of locally produced films. First of all, there are fantastic actor groups in foreign films which have highly quality film secnerios, and also have cooler special effect of action and animation. The Dune, for example, which produced by famous producer in the world and those actors whose act in film are also famous too. By contrast, those domestic produced films produced by nobody with slothful stories and act by unfamous actors, which have inferier viewed on the cenima. Even though those famous actors' film also lack marvlous stories.

In my opinion, it's helpful if goverments give more financial support to local film indestries instead of ignore it. Most of locally produced films don't have good stories and special effect. Additonally, the produce maker don't have enough money to made it happen. To do this, produce maker could employs more famous actors and high level producers to make incredible films. For example, the film Upgrade was supported by locally goverments and then got high viewed.

Broadly speaking, I believe that financial support will take an effect on those issues which were affect locally film industries developemnt.

It is indeed true that films from overseas often appear more captivating than those produced domestically. There are several factors contributing to this perception, and addressing these issues through increased government financial support could be highly beneficial.

A multitude of reasons underpin the preference for foreign films over domestic ones. Firstly, foreign films typically boast exceptional casts and high-quality cinematic scenarios, as well as stunning special effects in action and animation genres. For instance, "Dune" was produced by a renowned producer and featured well-known actors, which significantly contributed to its success. In contrast, domestic films are often produced by lesser-known individuals with uninspiring stories and feature less famous actors, leading to subpar viewing experiences in theaters. Even films with famous actors can suffer from lackluster storylines.

In my opinion, it would be immensely advantageous for governments to provide increased financial support to local film industries rather than neglecting them. Many locally produced films are hampered by a lack of compelling narratives and special effects. Moreover, producers often lack the necessary funds to realize their creative visions. To remedy this, producers could hire more renowned actors and high-caliber directors to create exceptional films. For example, the film "Upgrade" received local government support and subsequently enjoyed considerable viewership.

Broadly speaking, I believe that financial support can effectively address issues affecting the development of local film industries. By investing in storytelling and production quality, domestic films can compete more effectively with their overseas counterparts.
