## Before

As we can see from the given line graph, which compared proportion of population those who aged above 67 in three different countries between 1940 and 2040.

It is very clear that these three countries' proportion of population aged 65 and above keep rising overall from 1940 to 2040. However, Japan have exactly different growth tendency which looks suddenly and abnormal.

Back to 1940, America get about 9% proportion which higher than 7% in Sweden and 5% in Japan. In the next 50 years, America and Sweden's proportion almost keeping rising and almost get 15% nearly in 1982. By contrast, Japan's proportion keeping low key from 1940 to nearly 2002 and after then, data just looks different.

Whilst checking the proportion between 2000 and 2040, there's much different than before. Japan's proportion keeping rise gradully between 2002 and nearly 2030 which from 5% to 10% in nearly 2030, and then the proportion get 25% until nearly 2032. In 2040, Japan's proportion gets 27% which is the highest peak among the three country. At the sametime, America and Sweden's proportion still less than Japan which get 23% and 26% represently.



## Overall Score: 5.0

The response addresses the task but shows limitations in all areas. While some main features are reported, the analysis lacks depth and precision. The organization is basic with some coherence, but cohesion is often faulty. The vocabulary is limited and repetitive, with noticeable errors. Grammatical structures are limited and contain frequent errors that sometimes impede communication.

## After

The given line graph compares the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in three different countries between 1940 and 2040.

It is very clear that the proportion of the population aged 65 and above in these three countries keeps rising overall from 1940 to 2040.

In 1940, America has about a 9% proportion, which is higher than Sweden's 7% and Japan's 5%. However, Japan has a distinctly different growth trend, which appears sudden and abnormal. Over the next 50 years, the proportions for America and Sweden keep rising, reaching nearly 15% by 1982. By contrast, Japan's proportion remains low from 1940 to around 2002, after which the data shows a significant change.

## High Score Example(7.5)

The line graph compares the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in three countries - the United States, Sweden, and Japan - from 1940 to 2040.

Overall, all three countries show an upward trend in their elderly population over the century depicted, though the patterns and rates of increase vary significantly. Japan stands out for its dramatic rise in later decades.

In 1940, the United States had the highest proportion of over-65s at about 9%, followed by Sweden at 7% and Japan at just 5%. The US and Sweden saw gradual increases over the next 60 years, reaching around 15% by 2000. Japan's elderly population remained stable at about 5% until 1970, then began rising slowly.

However, from 2000 onwards, the trends diverge markedly. Japan's over-65 population accelerates rapidly, overtaking the other countries around 2015 and projected to reach 27% by 2040 - the highest of the three. Sweden shows a steady climb to 26% by 2040, while the US increase is more modest, reaching about 23%.

Notably, Japan transforms from having the lowest proportion of elderly citizens to the highest over the course of a century. The US, in contrast, moves from the highest percentage to the lowest. Sweden maintains a middle position throughout most of the period.

In conclusion, while all three nations face aging populations, Japan's demographic shift is particularly dramatic, with potential significant social and economic implications.
