# Task 1

## Map

### Before(me, band 6)

The map shows two locations for a brand-new supermarket in a town called Garlsdon, which have 65,000 population in this town. And there are two industry areas located in north and sorth of housing area respectively, and the town centre settled in middle of these two industry areas. There also is a railway through the whole countryside from location S1 to location S2.

It is clear that location S2 located in town centre without traffic zone, which surrounded by housing area. Whereas location S1 out of housing area, which far away from location S2. Location S2 have 12 and 16 kilometer road distance to Hindon and Bransdon, which have 10,000 and 15,000 population respectively. By contrast, location S2 have 25 kilometer road distance to Cransdon which have 29,000 population, as the most population place among the adjacent towns. However, Garlsdon's population also more than summary of these three adjacent towns' population.

### After(claude, band 7)

The map presents two potential locations for a new supermarket in Garlsdon, a town with a population of 65,000. The town has two industrial areas, one to the north and one to the south of the residential area, with the town center situated between them. A railway line runs through the countryside from location S1 to location S2.

It is evident that location S2 is situated in the town center, outside the traffic zone and surrounded by residential areas. In contrast, location S1 is outside the residential area and farther away from location S2. Location S2 is 12 kilometers and 16 kilometers away from Hindon and Bransdon, which have populations of 10,000 and 15,000 respectively. By contrast, location S2 is 25 kilometers away from Cransdon, which has a population of 29,000, the largest among the adjacent towns. However, Garlsdon's population is greater than the combined population of these three adjacent towns.

## Average house prices in five cities

### Before(me, band 6)

The solid bar chart compares the expenditure in different cities over the period of 13 years from 1989.

## Global water use by sector

### Before(me, band 6)

The dotted graph shows the global water using trend by different sectors between 1990 and 2000, and the table shows the data on water consumption in Brazil and Congo in 2000.

It is evident that different sectors water using trend both are increasely. However, water used by agriculture highly more than others. And in the year 2000, we also can see that the water consumption of Brazil is higher than Congo.

In 1900, there was huge difference in global water used by agriculture than other sectors, which is reaches in 500. Whereas the global water used by industrial and demestic far lower than that value, which amount is 200. By 2000, agriculture water using was twofold of industiral using and threefold of domestic use, which almost is 3000.

In the year 2000, Brazil and Congo had 176m and 5.2m population respectively. And with mind with that, Brazil's water consumption was more than 40 times of Congo, which are 359 and 8 respectively.

### After(kimi, band 7)

The dotted graph illustrates the global water usage trend by different sectors between 1990 and 2000, while the table presents data on water consumption in Brazil and Congo in 2000.

It is evident that the water usage trend is increasing for all sectors, with agriculture consuming the highest amount of water. In the year 2000, Brazil's water consumption was notably higher than that of Congo.

In 1990, there was a significant difference in global water usage by agriculture compared to other sectors, reaching a value of 500 units. In contrast, the water usage by industry and domestic sectors was considerably lower, amounting to 200 units each. By 2000, agriculture's water usage had doubled that of industry and tripled that of domestic use, reaching nearly 3000 units.

In the year 2000, Brazil and Congo had populations of 176 million and 5.2 million, respectively. Consequently, Brazil's water consumption was more than 40 times that of Congo, with figures standing at 359 million cubic meters for Brazil and 8 million cubic meters for Congo.



## The table below gives information on consumer spending on different items in five different countries in 2002.

### Before(me, band 6)

## The Life Circle of Honey Bee

### Before(me, band 6)

The diagram illustrates the life circle of honey bee. At the same time, we can see that the life circle of honey bee will last between 34 and 36 days. Besides, there are five main stages in the life circle, from baby bee to maturity.

The beginning of the life circle of honey bee is female bee lays one or two eggs every three days. While eggs will hatched after nine or ten days, and then each egg will turn into incomplete life body which is called nymph.

From then, over the next five days, the nymph involving moulting stage which is appear baby honey bee. And after seven days and another nine days, young adult honey bee emerges. When the whole life circle reached 30 or 31 days, the young adult honey bee will finished the final moulting stage, and then the maturity honey bee birth out after 4 days.

### After(Kimi, band 7)

The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a honey bee, which typically lasts between 34 and 36 days. There are five main stages in the life cycle, from birth to maturity.

The life cycle of a honey bee begins when a female bee lays one or two eggs every three days. These eggs hatch after nine or ten days, transforming into an immature form known as a nymph.

Subsequently, over the next five days, the nymph undergoes a molting stage, emerging as a larval honey bee. After seven days, followed by another nine days, a young adult honey bee emerges. When the entire life cycle reaches 30 or 31 days, the young adult honey bee completes its final molting stage. Finally, after four more days, the mature honey bee emerges.
