## Global water use by sector

### Before(me, band 6)

The dotted graph shows the global water using trend by different sectors between 1990 and 2000, and the table shows the data on water consumption in Brazil and Congo in 2000.

It is evident that different sectors water using trend both are increasely. However, water used by agriculture highly more than others. And in the year 2000, we also can see that the water consumption of Brazil is higher than Congo.

In 1900, there was huge difference in global water used by agriculture than other sectors, which is reaches in 500. Whereas the global water used by industrial and demestic far lower than that value, which amount is 200. By 2000, agriculture water using was twofold of industiral using and threefold of domestic use, which almost is 3000.

In the year 2000, Brazil and Congo had 176m and 5.2m population respectively. And with mind with that, Brazil's water consumption was more than 40 times of Congo, which are 359 and 8 respectively.

### After(kimi, band 7)

The dotted graph illustrates the global water usage trend by different sectors between 1990 and 2000, while the table presents data on water consumption in Brazil and Congo in 2000.

It is evident that the water usage trend is increasing for all sectors, with agriculture consuming the highest amount of water. In the year 2000, Brazil's water consumption was notably higher than that of Congo.

In 1990, there was a significant difference in global water usage by agriculture compared to other sectors, reaching a value of 500 units. In contrast, the water usage by industry and domestic sectors was considerably lower, amounting to 200 units each. By 2000, agriculture's water usage had doubled that of industry and tripled that of domestic use, reaching nearly 3000 units.

In the year 2000, Brazil and Congo had populations of 176 million and 5.2 million, respectively. Consequently, Brazil's water consumption was more than 40 times that of Congo, with figures standing at 359 million cubic meters for Brazil and 8 million cubic meters for Congo.



## The table below gives information on consumer spending on different items in five different countries in 2002.

### Before(me, band 6)

The plain table shows the data on consumer spending on different items in five different countries over 2002. In particullarly, the table shows percentage of national consumer expenditure by different categories.

It is clear that Turkey reaches 32.14% on food, drinks and tobacco, which is the highest porprotion. By contrast, Sweden reaches 15.77% which is the lowest percentage on these needs. For clothing and footwear needs, Italy have the highest percentage which is 9%, and Sweden still is the lowest one which is 5.4%. For leisure and education, Turkey also have the highest percentage which is 4.35%, and Spain have the lowest percentage which is 1.98%.

The fact that all of these countries' consumer have similar consumation habits which is likely pay more money on food, drinks and tobaco, and pay less money on leisure and education. Besides, the expenditure on food, drinks and tobacco more than multiple times with other needs. 

### After(Kimi, band 7)

The table presents data on consumer spending on different items in five countries for the year 2002. Specifically, it shows the percentage of national consumer expenditure by various categories.

It is evident that Turkey spends the highest proportion, at 32.14%, on food, drinks, and tobacco. In contrast, Sweden has the lowest percentage for these items, at 15.77%. Regarding clothing and footwear, Italy has the highest percentage at 9%, while Sweden remains the lowest at 5.4%. For leisure and education, Turkey also leads with the highest percentage, 4.35%, and Spain trails with the lowest percentage, at 1.98%.

A common consumption pattern among these countries is that consumers tend to spend more on food, drinks, and tobacco and less on leisure and education. Moreover, the expenditure on food, drinks, and tobacco is multiple times higher than that on other needs.

## Monthly Temperature and Precipitation

### Before(me, band 6)

The solid bar shows the data of temperature and precipitation in different month between Jan and Dec.

It is clear that the monthly precipitation have huge gap between different months, whereas the monthly temperature give a steady trend. Broadly speaking, the highest precipitation lasts from Jun to Sep, and the hotest temperature remains on Mar and Jun.

From Jan to Apr, the lowest precipitation remains under the 20mm in Jan, and the highest one almost reaches to 50mm. In the same period, the lowest  temperature is 20 Celes and keeping rise to 30 Celes.

While temperatures almost remain same trend in the next four months, whereas precipitation give strong change in the same time which is doubled as before. Figures for precipitation reach to 250mm from Jun to Sep, and for temperature which almost reach to 30 Celse in the same period. The final three months, temperatures and precipitation meet same trend which dropped a lot. Figures for temperature drop to 20 Celse from Oct to Dec, and for precipitation which drop to 10mm from Oct to Dec.

### After(Kimi, band 7)

The solid bar chart illustrates the data of temperature and precipitation in different months from January to December.

It is evident that there is a significant variation in monthly precipitation across different months, while the monthly temperature shows a consistent trend. Generally speaking, the highest precipitation occurs from June to September, and the hottest temperatures are observed in May.

From January to April, the lowest precipitation is under 20mm in January, and the highest one almost reaches 50mm in April. During the same period, the lowest temperature is 20 degrees Celsius in January and steadily rises to 30 degrees Celsius in April.

While temperatures maintain a similar trend over the next four months, precipitation shows a drastic change, doubling from before. Precipitation figures reach 250mm from June to September, and temperatures also peak at almost 30 degrees Celsius during the same period. In the final three months, both temperatures and precipitation follow a similar trend, dropping significantly. Temperature figures drop to 20 degrees Celsius from October to December, and precipitation decreases to 10mm from October to December.

## The Life Circle of Honey Bee

### Before(me, band 6)

The diagram illustrates the life circle of honey bee. At the same time, we can see that the life circle of honey bee will last between 34 and 36 days. Besides, there are five main stages in the life circle, from baby bee to maturity.

The beginning of the life circle of honey bee is female bee lays one or two eggs every three days. While eggs will hatched after nine or ten days, and then each egg will turn into incomplete life body which is called nymph.

From then, over the next five days, the nymph involving moulting stage which is appear baby honey bee. And after seven days and another nine days, young adult honey bee emerges. When the whole life circle reached 30 or 31 days, the young adult honey bee will finished the final moulting stage, and then the maturity honey bee birth out after 4 days.

### After(Kimi, band 7)

The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a honey bee, which typically lasts between 34 and 36 days. There are five main stages in the life cycle, from birth to maturity.

The life cycle of a honey bee begins when a female bee lays one or two eggs every three days. These eggs hatch after nine or ten days, transforming into an immature form known as a nymph.

Subsequently, over the next five days, the nymph undergoes a molting stage, emerging as a larval honey bee. After seven days, followed by another nine days, a young adult honey bee emerges. When the entire life cycle reaches 30 or 31 days, the young adult honey bee completes its final molting stage. Finally, after four more days, the mature honey bee emerges.

## Average annual expenditures on different phone services, 2001-2010

### Before(me, band 6)

The line graph compares average annual expenditures on different phone services between 2001 and 2010.

It is clear that cost on mobile phone services was gradually dropped down over the 10 years, and cost on residential phone services was rose steadily. Plus, in 2006, spending data shows a balance on each phone services.

In the year 2001, spending on moblie phone services only reached out $200, and spending on residential phone services was a huge gap which reached out almost nearly $700. In the next five years, spending on moblie phone services was decreased slowly, instead of spending on residential phone services was increased quickly.

In 2006, each cost of these two phone services was remained same which reached out $500. And then, in 2010, cost on mobile phone services was just dropped down to $400. By contrast, cost on residential phone services was increased to $750 rocketly.

### After(kimi, band 7)

The line graph compares the average annual expenditures on different phone services between 2001 and 2010.

It is evident that the costs for mobile phone services gradually decreased over the 10-year period, while the costs for residential phone services rose steadily. Additionally, in 2006, the spending on each phone service was equal.

In 2001, expenditures on mobile phone services only reached $200, whereas spending on residential phone services was significantly higher, almost reaching $700. Over the following five years, expenditures on mobile phone services decreased slowly, whereas spending on residential phone services increased rapidly.

In 2006, the cost of each of these two phone services remained the same, reaching $500. By 2010, the cost for mobile phone services had dropped to $400. In contrast, the cost for residential phone services had rocketed to $750.
