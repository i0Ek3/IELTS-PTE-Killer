## Task 2

In recent times, working time has been a subject of intense debate. There are those who firmly believe that the working time should be shorter and the weekend should be longer. From my perspective, I totally agree with the view that employee should enjoy longer weekend.

One of the reason of my agreement is that shorter working time could bring greater work effectivity by employee. In fact, employee will adjust their work schedule according their work time, which means that they will ensure the work will be deliveried on time. For example, if a company only work for four days and then the employee will distributed their work into these days, they will make progress quickly. By contrast, if there is a company who work for five days, the employee will delay their work until the last day.  

Creativity also contributing to another reason. Longer weekend offer employee more opportunities to explore the things what they really like to do, which means the creativity from themselves are triggered by non-stressful environment, they do things only follow on their heart without any other considerations affect by their work. One of the example of this is Linus who is the creator of the programmer community GitHub, which was created after his work day off in the longer weekend. If there is no chance to let Linus to enjoy longer weekend, that would be not possible to us to see this tremendous community.

To sum up, after careful consideration of both sides of the argument, it is evident that employee should enjoy longer weekend and shorter working time. By doing this, employee could not only become more productivity and high-quality but also more creativity.



### **雅思Task 2作文评分：**

**任务回应（Task Response）**: 6
**连贯与衔接（Coherence and Cohesion）**: 6
**词汇（Lexical Resource）**: 6
**语法（Grammatical Range and Accuracy）**: 5

### **分析与修改建议：**

#### 1. **任务回应（Task Response）**：

- **优点**：你明确表达了观点，并且支持了自己的立场——员工应该享受更长的周末和更短的工作时间。你提供了理由和例子来阐明这一观点。
- **不足**：尽管你有理由支持自己的观点，但论点的深度和逻辑性稍显不足。你提供的例子（如Linus和GitHub的故事）虽然有趣，但细节不够明确，且和论点的关联略显薄弱。对于问题的讨论不够全面，尤其是对反方观点的回应不够。

**改进建议**：

- 进一步深入分析反方观点（比如，有些人可能认为缩短工作时间会导致企业效率下降，或者员工的收入减少），并进行合理的反驳。
- 可以提供更多的数据或研究支持你的观点，这样会使论点更具说服力。

#### 2. **连贯与衔接（Coherence and Cohesion）**：

- **优点**：文章有明确的结构，每一段都围绕一个主要观点展开，段落之间的衔接相对清晰。
- **不足**：某些句子和段落的衔接不够自然。比如，在第二段中“By contrast, if there is a company who work for five days, the employee will delay their work until the last day.”这一句，和前文的内容关系不太紧密，衔接略显生硬。

**改进建议**：

- 使用更多的连接词来增强段落之间的流畅性。例如，可以使用“On the other hand”替代“By contrast”，以及“Furthermore”或“Moreover”来加强句子的衔接。
- 注意不同观点之间的过渡，尽量避免突兀的跳跃。

#### 3. **词汇（Lexical Resource）**：

- **优点**：你尝试使用了一些较为丰富的词汇，如“effectivity”， “deliveried”（意为“交付”）等。
- **不足**：存在一些用词不当或拼写错误，如“effectivity”应为“effectiveness”，“deliveried”应为“delivered”。另外，“employee”应使用复数形式“employees”。
- 另外，某些词汇的使用不够自然或不够准确，例如“contributing to another reason”可以改为“contributes to another reason”，以及“creativity from themselves are triggered”可以改为“their creativity is triggered”。

**改进建议**：

- 检查拼写和词汇使用，避免出现拼写错误。
- 使用更准确和自然的表达方式，例如“increased productivity”替代“greater work effectivity”。
- 提高用词的多样性，避免重复使用“employee”。

#### 4. **语法（Grammatical Range and Accuracy）**：

- **优点**：你使用了多种句型结构，包括复合句和简单句。

- 不足

  ：存在一些语法错误，比如主谓一致问题、动词时态使用错误等。例如：

  - “One of the reason” 应改为 “One of the reasons”。
  - “employee should enjoy” 中的“employee”需要改为复数形式“employees”。
  - “which means that they will ensure the work will be deliveried on time.” 这句中的“deliveried”是错误的，应该改为“delivered”，并且可以考虑简化为“ensuring work is delivered on time”。

**改进建议**：

- 注重语法细节，特别是主谓一致和时态的使用。
- 在修改时检查每个句子的结构，确保语法的准确性。

### **综合评分**：

这篇作文的得分大致为 **6 分**。你表达了自己的观点并且给出了理由和例子，但逻辑深度不足，词汇和语法方面也有一些问题。为了提高分数，你可以更深入地展开论述，完善语法和词汇使用，同时增强文章的流畅性和自然性。

For instance, Linus, the creator of the GitHub programming community, reportedly came up with the idea for the platform during his extended weekends. Without the opportunity to enjoy longer weekends, such innovations might never have occurred.
