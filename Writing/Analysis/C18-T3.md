The diagram clearly summarizes the changes that have taken place in a particular area of the central library over a 20-year period.

It is clear that the library has undergone significant changes. To be more specific, a corridor now divides the library into four sections. The overall structure of the library has remained the same, with no major changes in its external layout.

Several areas of the library have been removed and replaced with new spaces. For example, the leisure section in the top-left corner has been replaced with a storytelling room containing two sofas. The children’s books section in the top-right corner has been replaced by a lecture room, and the reading room in the bottom-left corner has been replaced by a computer room. The entrance to the computer room has also been altered. Additionally, the enquiry desk area in the bottom-right corner has been rebuilt as a café, with a door leading to the west.

Moreover, the tables and chairs in the central section of the library have been removed. The adult fiction section, previously located in the western part of the central area, has been moved to the eastern side, while the original location has been converted into a reference books section. Additionally, the adult non-fiction section in the eastern part of the library has been replaced by an information desk, complete with self-service machines.

In conclusion, the library’s layout has undergone significant transformations over the past 20 years, with the introduction of new sections such as the storytelling room and café, as well as the relocation of several book sections. These changes reflect the library’s adaptation to the evolving needs of its visitors.

## Task 2

In recent times, the issue of the proportion of people in the countryside has experienced a downward trend in many countries around the world. There are several reasons cause this problem. In this essay, we will explore the root causes of this problem and give my own view on whether this movement is a positive or not.

The root cause of this problem is that the development of civilization may bring more opportunities for those people who lived in the rural areas. Under this process, convenient transportation and greater lifestyle may contributes to this phenomenon. By contrast, if such people live in rural section all the time, while they will trap into some terrible situations such as lack of diversity activities, less enjoyment in daily life and barely chance to communicate with different backgrouds people. Furthermore, considerable consideration also contributing to this problem. However, when people likely to move to cities, things can be huge distinctives. 

From my perspective, this trend may be taken a positive development. Those people who moved to cities will obtain more job opportunities and enjoy the good form of life. One example of this is when the rural people move to cities, which may reduce the stress to local labor markets and promote economy effects, also the ability of consumption will be increase which means that they could bring more GDP revenues. Hence, it is undeniable this behaviour may bring more positive feedbacks.

In conclusion, it is evident that this is a positive development, which can enhence the social stalibity and cohesion.

In recent times, the proportion of people living in rural areas has been decreasing in many countries around the world. There are several reasons for this trend, and in this essay, I will explore its root causes and discuss whether this movement is positive or not.”

One of the main reasons for this trend is that urbanization offers more opportunities to people living in rural areas. With the development of cities, factors such as convenient transportation, better healthcare, and a higher quality of life attract many people to move to urban areas. On the other hand, those who stay in rural areas may face challenges such as limited access to diverse activities, fewer job opportunities, and limited social interaction with people from different backgrounds.

From my perspective, this trend can be seen as a positive development. People who move to cities often find better job opportunities, improved living conditions, and a higher standard of living. For example, as rural people migrate to cities, the labor market in rural areas may become less competitive, which can help reduce unemployment rates in the cities. Furthermore, increased consumption in urban areas can boost the local economy and contribute to higher GDP.

In conclusion, this movement towards urbanization brings numerous benefits, including enhanced economic development and social stability. While there are challenges, the overall impact on both individuals and society is positive, leading to greater cohesion and prosperity.
