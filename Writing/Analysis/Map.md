The maps clearly summarize the changes that have taken  place in the Porth harbour over a more than 20-year period, from 2000 to the present day.

It is obvious that this place had changed a lot. To be more specific, the harbour and the road divide the map into three main sections. The public beach, located in the northern part of the map, the showers and toilets in the western part of the harbour, and the car park in the bottom left-hand corner, were still there without any change. However, the disused castle in the southeast of harbour had been replaced by a hotel, and the public beach in the bottom part of harbour has been replaced by a private beach.

Turning to the central area of the harbour, this region has been redeveloped into a space for cafes and shops. Additionally, the dock in the northeast of the harbour and showers and toilets in the western have been expanded. Furthermore, a new road has been added in the bottom section of the harbour. Moreover, the locations of the marina and fishing boats have also changed.

Overall, it is clear that Porth harbour has become much more modernized, with increased infrastructure but less open space compared to the past.
