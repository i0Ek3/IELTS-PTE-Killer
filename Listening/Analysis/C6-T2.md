正确率只有 3/10，精听后正确率 9/10。错误的那个在犹豫要不要加 years，结果加了就错了。

## P2

正确率只有 4/10，精听后正确率 7/10。其中一个多写了 Station，另一个多写了 fees，还有个是理解错误，一是把 essential 记成了本质上，二是误以为让填写限制的人数。

## P3

正确率只有 3/10，精听后正确率仅有 6/10。其中一个错过了，没想起来是什么。有一个是多写了一个 s，还有个是把 of 写成了 the，还有个是多写了一个单词，要命。最后发现多写单词的，基本上都是没怎么仔细读题的，比如这次，题干里已经写了 managing，我还是在填空里写了 management，显然重复了，而且也没做检查。
