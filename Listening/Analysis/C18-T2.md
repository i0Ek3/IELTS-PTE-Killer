# C18-T2 Listening

分数：5.5    总题数：40    错误题数：18   正确题数：22

感觉临近考试前的整套练习效果不佳，做题时间上基本是没问题的，就是怎么能提到正确率这才是更重要的事情。所以打算再调整下策略，明确下做题思路，而不是盲目刷题了。

## P1

6/10

2 我贴心的给加了 s。

4 我又贴心的给加了 s。

5 还是之前的老毛病，听到前面的就不往后听了，正确答案在后面。原文提到 So the only other thing that’s required is good communication skills, so you’ll need to have a certificate in English.

10 这里说的是 No work，所以我在听到 There’s a lot of evening and weekend work, but they’re closed on Mondays 后，根据词性就写了 Monday。随后又说 But you do get one Sunday off every four weeks，也就是说你可以在 Sunday 休息的。

## P2

5/10

14 原文提到 but the overall feedback has been that the design and facilities of the development make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily，也就是 C 项所描述的。

地图题还是一塌糊涂，待会儿精听一下。

15 原文提到 there's a road from there that goes right up through the development. The school will be on that road, at the corner of the second turning to the left，因此 school 在 G 处。

16 原文提到 This will be on the western side of the development, just below the road that branches off from London Road，即在分叉路的下方 C 处。

18 原文提到 On the northeast side of the development, there'll be a row of specially designed houses specifically for residents over 65, and the community centre will be adjoining this，也就是与 housing for the elderly 相邻处，即 B。

20 原文提到 If you look at the road that goes up from the South Entrance, you'll see it curves round to the left at the top, and the playground will be in that curve, with nice views of the lake. 说明实在拐弯处，即 A。

## P3

8/10

单选和匹配都对了，多选其实有点犯蠢。我以为单选完了就没了，会停一下然后播放下一段听力。结果它还在那一直说，等我反应过来还有多选时，已经结束了，所以随便选了两个🤣。

25 提到 but not that the effects would go on for so long，说明是 B。

26 提到 Or that two years after the eruption, strange weather events were being reported as far away as North America and North Africa，说明是 A。

## P4

3/10

这个也是很离谱，感觉最近几次做 P4，每次都挺紧张的，生怕漏掉，结果正是因为紧张，所以还是漏掉了很多。

31 反应不过来。虽然也听到了 convenient，但是还是继续往下听了，直到出现了 fashion item 我就写了。实际定位句是 nothing is quite as convenient as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket.

32 感觉就很气，该听到复数的地方总是少写，没有复数的地方又给加上了 s，几乎毫无例外，我真的是要被气死了。原文提到 hat was the time when suits became popular，而且这个说的还是比较清晰的，我还是没听到，不知道是不小心的还是故意的。

33 原文提到 but all three garments were lined with material and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever tailor the customer used。但是我把这句话给理解错了，我以为是什么东西被缝到 pocket 里，虽然也听到了 tailor，但是我把 tailor 记成了剪刀，直接晕死。

34 因为在反应上一题，导致这一题有点漏听了，只听到了后面的职业，所以我写了 careers。实际提到 but they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a profession who needed to carry medical instruments，所以应该为 profession。

35 原文提到 For one thing, they weren't nearly as visible or as easy to reach as men's，因此这里为 visible。但是我没反应过来，写了 accessiable。

37 只听到了最后一个单词 cloth（人家说的复数我也没听到），实际提到 Women tied the pockets around their waist so that they hung beneath their clothes，因此为 waist。

39 原文提到 That's when dresses became tighter and less bulky, and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable – they stood out too much and detracted from the woman's image，即 changed dresses 有损 women's image.
