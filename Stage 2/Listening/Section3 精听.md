# Section3 精听

> 重复造就力量。

根据之前复习和考试的情况，对过往真题中 Section3 部分进行精听训练，只精听，不做题。

精听采用倍速阶梯精听法，初期采用 1x 1.25x 1.5x 1.25x 1x 听，进阶采用 1.5x 2.0x 1.5x 1.25x 1x 听，对考场听力速度进行降维打击。

过程中记录三方面的笔记：连读，生词，长难句。适当辅以其他听力材料的泛听，锻炼快速抓取材料逻辑结构、信号词的能力。

精听的另一个目的是克服口语对话中听不清楚对方说辞的问题，你要能先听明白对方说的，才能更进一步地回答要点。

更具体地，先将听力内容（可以是剑雅真题听力，也可以是电视剧片段或者视频等）简单浏览一遍，有一个大概印象。然后解决内容中的生词、地道表达等。然后采用 1x 1.25x 1.5x 1.25x 1x 精听，精听过程中可以跟读对发音进行训练，掌握连读、弱读、重读部分，直至形成自己的习惯。

此后，要能锻炼识别整个句意的能力。精听更多地是练习细节，但是别人说话是一整个句子输出的，不会一点一点断续输出的。所以在完成细节方面的练习后，要能对整个句意进行把控，可以在一定程度上解决听了后面忘前面的问题。

耗时 3h34m，从 19:00 开始听，一直到 22:34 结束。这次暂且没有按照上面的节奏进行精听，自己先找了下感觉。先单句听，直到没有听不出的，然后 1x 1.25x 1.5x 1.8x 2.0x 1.8x 1.5 1.25 1x 单句听，将全篇听完。之后再 1x 1.25x 1.5x 1.8x 2.0x 1.8x 1.5 1.25 1x 整篇听。感觉确实不一样，神清气爽。
