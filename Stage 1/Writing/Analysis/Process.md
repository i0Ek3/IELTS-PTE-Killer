The diagrams clearly divide the process of producing silk cloth into two main parts, each consisting of its own processes and stages, using different materials.

**In the first part**, the first diagram illustrates the life cycle of the silkworm. First, eggs are laid by silkworms on mulberry leaves. After 10 days, the eggs hatch into silkworm larvae, which feed on the mulberry leaves. After 4 to 6 weeks, the larvae spin silk threads, which they use to form their cocoons. Within another 3 to 8 days, the larvae completely transform into cocoons. Finally, after 16 days, the cocoons turn into moths, completing the life cycle of the silkworm.

**Moving on to the second part**, the cocoons are used to produce silk cloth. First, the cocoons are selected for processing. Then, they are boiled in hot water in large containers. After boiling, the cocoons are unwound into long silk threads, which range from 300 to 900 meters in length. After this, the silk threads are dyed in large containers and then woven into fabric using a weaving machine.

**In summary**, the process of producing silk cloth involves two main stages: the life cycle of the silkworm and the processing of the cocoons into silk threads. The silk is then dyed and woven to create the final fabric.

The diagrams show that the process of producing cement and then how to use cement to producing concrete.

In the cement production, the process clearly divides four main stages, by using limestone, clay as raw material. In the first stage, limestone and clay, which are regarded as the raw materials for crushing production, had crushed by crusher, and then the powder are added into mixer. After processing by using heat in rotating heater, the outputs of last step had ground by grinder. After being ground, the cement was generated, then pack them into bags. 

In the concrete production, the process only have one main stage, by using cement with 15%, water with 10%, sand with 25% and gravel with 50% as raw material. In this main stage, all of these raw materials have been mixed by concrete mixer with clockwise rotating.

Overall, it is evident that the process of producing cement and concrete mainly bases on the physical change, and the procedures of crushing, rotating and mixing are the dominant steps as well as cannot be substituted by any other step.

Salmon begin life as eggs on a pebbly riverbed, hidden among reeds in the slow-moving upper reaches of a river. After five to six months the eggs hatch into 'fry'. For approximately the next four years, these baby salmon will live in the lower, faster-flowing waters of their river. During this time they measure between three and eight centimetres in length.

By the time salmon reach twelve to fifteen centimetres, they are termed 'smolt, and at this time they migrate further downriver into the open sea. After five years at sea the salmon will have grown to adult size, which is between seventy and seventy-six centimetres. They then begin swimming back to their birthplace, where they will lay their eggs, and the cycle starts anew.

In summary, the salmon passes through three distinct physical stages as it grows to maturity. Each of these stages takes place in a very different aquatic location. It is noteworthy that the first two stages of this fish's life occur in a freshwater environment, while the stage is lived in saltwater.

The flow chart clearly divides the process of producing geothermal energy up into 3 main stages, by using cold water, hot rocks and double wells as raw material.

Initially, in the first stage, cold water is pumped down by the injection well, which has a depth of 4.5 kilometers. After cold water is pumped down, it is heated by the geothermal zone, which consists of hot rocks. After being heated, the hot water is pumped up by the production well and stored in a condenser.

Moving to the next stage, the steam is condensed in the condensing machine, after which the steam transported to a new process, which consists of a turbine machine powered by steam to generate power and a generator powered by the turbine to produce electricity. Finally, in the last stage, the electricity is generated by generator after being powered by the turbine and then transported to the geothermal power plant.

Overall, it is clear that the process of producing the geothermal energy mainly relies on physical changes, and the procedures of heating, condensing and generating are the dominant steps, which cannot be substituted by any other steps.

A hydroelectric power station can generate electric power by using the energy of water flowing from high level to low level. It works different functions in day and night.

In the day time, water in the high-level reservoir go through the intake under the dam which is only open in day time. Then the water flow into the power station in which there is a generator. The generator is operated by a reversible turbines that can transfer the water flowing force to the mechanical force which is the power of the generator. The generated electricity then goes to the national grid through the power lines.

On the other hand in the night time, the power station works in a reversed way. It pumps water from the low-level reservoir to high-level reservoir to provide the enough water for day time's work. The water is pumped by the same reversible turbines from low-level reservoir. So the power station actually consumes energy at night. But that is in order to generate more power in the day time.

In a conclusion, a hydroelectric power station can generate power is based on the differce heighth of water level. In day time, it uses the natural water energy. Meanwhile in the night, it transfers the water to create and store the energy for the next day.

The diagram shows that the process of producing instant noodles up into 3 main stages, by using flour, water and oil as raw material.

Initially, in the first stage, flour is added into storage silos. Then, the flour, water, oil are mixed together by a mixing machine. After mixing, the resulting mixture is prepared for further processing.

Moving to the next stage, the mixture is rolled by a rolling machine, after which the dough sheets are formed. Then, the dough strips are generated by a cutting machine. Once the noodles are cut, they are set into noodles discs. Afterward, they are cooked and dried by cooking and drying machines.

In the last stage, the processed noodles are packed into cups, and at the same time, dried vegetables and spices are added to the cups. After adding auxiliaries, the cups are labeled and sealed by labeling and sealing machines. Finally, the instant noodles product is completed.

Overall, it is evident that the process of producing instant noodles mainly relies on physical changes, and the procedures of mixing, rolling and drying are the dominant steps, which cannot be substituted by any other steps.
