## Work

我在xx担任后端研发工程师有近两年的时间，工作地点在西二旗地铁站附近。整体上我们的工作气氛是比较紧张的，节奏也会比较快，加班也是常态化的事情。不过周围的同事都很好相处，有不错的薪水，总体上还是比较满意的。

I've been working as a backend development engineer at xx for nearly two years, and my workplace is located near Xierqi subway station. Overall, the work atmosphere is quite intense, and the pace is fast; working overtime has become a regular occurrence. However, I get along well with my colleagues, and the salary is quite good, so on the whole, I am quite satisfied with my job.

## Study

我当时是在xx读的大学，读的专业是计算机应用技术。xx是一个非常接地气的城市，这里有很多古建筑和当地特色美食，而且这边的人也比较豪放，相处起来比较自在，非常适合生活。

I attended university in xx, where I studied Computer Science. xx is a very down-to-earth city with a rich history and a strong sense of local culture. There are numerous ancient architectural sites and local specialty foods that make the city quite charming. The people here are quite hearty and straightforward, which makes getting along with them very comfortable. I find it a very livable city with its unique blend of history, culture, and hospitality.

## Lived City

我目前在xx生活。这里很空旷，也很辽阔，在这里不会有大城市那种紧张的感觉。但是对我自己来说，这里可能并不是最适合我的地方。因为我有鼻炎和鼻窦炎，这边有一些我的过敏原，导致我会有过敏反应，真的很要命。所以如果你也有这样的症状的话，应该避免来这边玩，否则还是非常值得来玩一玩的。

I'm currently living in xx, which is quite spacious and vast place, so living here, you won't experience the stress and tension that comes with living in a big city. However, personally, I find that this might not be the best place for me. You see, I suffer from rhinitis and sinusitis, and there are allergens here that trigger my allergies, which is really debilitating. So, if you have similar symptoms, you might want to avoid visiting this area. Otherwise, it's definitely worth coming to see and enjoy the place.

## 1 Person

> who/what/when/how/why

我想描述的这个人是我的叔叔，大概不到 60 的样子，当然我们并没有血缘关系，你可以说我们是忘年交。在我读研究生的过程中，他给我了很多学习上和生活上的建议，我真的很敬佩他。他很真诚也很热心，也非常有毅力，对我非常好。在我遇到困难时，帮我出谋划策。还邀请我到他家里做客，做美食给我吃。

我们是在健身房认识的，当时我在健身房和同伴不知道该怎么使用健身器材，正好这位叔叔在跟前，我们就向他请教了下如何使用。他很详细地教我们如何使用这些器材，以及指导我们每个动作应该怎么做，表示感谢后我们就自己练习了。后面再去健身房的时候，发现这个叔叔每次都在，一来二去我们就互相认识了。后面熟络后，我们就一起搭伴健身。我的同伴不喜欢撸铁，所以我和这位叔叔一起撸铁。撸铁过程中，也在互相聊天，聊生活以及人生等。

和这个叔叔一起健身时间久了，确实经历了一些有趣的事情。有次我和这位叔叔都在健身房，我先去浴室洗漱了，进到浴室，有另一位打过照面的人问我：你老爸呢？看你老爸把你练的很辛苦啊！我尴尬的笑了笑。后面叔叔进来浴室，我跟他说，你听到刚才那个人说的了吗？他说他听到了，他也笑了笑。还有次我们一起走在路上，叔叔的朋友看到了我们，说：呦，大哥的儿子都这么大了！我和叔叔都笑了。虽然这并不是事实，但是叔叔待我确实像儿子般，我很感激他。

只不过后来，研究生即将毕业，疫情也来了，我就回老家了，再见叔叔的机会也比较少了，不过我们还是会定期视频聊聊近况，互相道个平安。这段经历真的很美好。

The person I'd like to talk about is a man who is like an uncle to me, though technically we're not related by blood. You could say we're friends across generations. He's probably not quite 60 years old, and he's been a great source of advice and support for me during my graduate studies. I have a lot of respect for him. He's sincere, warm-hearted, and very persevering, and he's always been very good to me, helping me with strategies when I face difficulties and inviting me to his home for delicious meals.

We met at the gym. I was there with a friend, trying to figure out how to use some of the equipment, and this uncle happened to be nearby. He showed us in detail how to use the machines and guided us through the exercises. After that, we saw him at the gym every time we went, and we gradually got to know each other. As we became more familiar, we started working out together. Since my friend wasn't into weightlifting, I ended up lifting weights with this uncle. During our workouts, we'd chat about life and various other topics.

Over time, we had some interesting experiences together at the gym. Once, after a workout, I went to the bathroom and someone who recognized me asked where my dad was, commenting on how hard I'd been training. I just smiled awkwardly. When my uncle came into the bathroom, I told him what had happened, and we both had a good laugh. Another time, we were walking together, and his friend saw us and said that uncle's son had grown up so much. We both laughed at that. Although it wasn't true, he did treat me like a son, and I'm very grateful for that.

As my graduate studies came to an end and the pandemic hit, I returned to my hometown, and the chances to see my uncle became fewer. However, we still keep in touch through regular video calls to check up on each other. This experience has been truly wonderful.

### 地点类

我想要谈论的地点是北京超级合生汇，坐落于北京市昌平区生命科学园地铁站附近，毗邻中关村区域，交通便利，覆盖约230万常住消费人口。

该项目以“泛文娱”为内核，超越购物中心的定势思维，融汇多元新兴业态带来的极致体验，打造“创文化、策娱乐、潮运动”的全新场域。未来将成为北京北部最大，最具吸引力的商业融合体，辐射全北京的Z世代新兴消费人群。

首先，超级合生汇是一个集娱乐、餐饮、零售于一体的综合体，这就意味着你可以无缝享受这些服务。比如周末或者工作日下班，你就可以叫上三两好友一起去这里看电影，喝咖啡休闲，吃饭，购物聊天，非常的惬意。其次，这里的服务和环境也是相当到位的。你能在这里感受到特别的服务，非常的舒心，一切都是那么地顺畅。当然，它也有一些缺点。首当其冲地，那就是大，它实在是太大了。如果一个人步行从底层开始逛，我感觉一天也是逛不完的，所以多逛一会还是会比较累的。其次，这里的物价并不会比外面的小商店便宜。普通的饮品几乎都要 30RMB 一杯，单件鞋子衣服的价格也是更胜一筹，大概几百上千不等。

The place I'd like to discuss is Beijing Super Hopson One, located near the Life Science Park subway station in Changping District, adjacent to the Zhongguancun area, and conveniently accessible, covering a population of about 2.3 million permanent consumers.

This project is centered around the concept of "pan-entertainment," transcending the conventional thinking of shopping centers by integrating a variety of emerging business formats to provide an ultimate experience, creating a new field of "creative culture, strategic entertainment, and trendy sports." It is set to become the largest and most attractive commercial complex in northern Beijing, catering to the new consumer groups of Generation Z across the entire city.

Firstly, Super Hopson One is a comprehensive complex that integrates entertainment, dining, and retail, which means you can enjoy these services seamlessly. For instance, on weekends or after work on weekdays, you can invite a few friends to watch a movie here, have a leisurely coffee, dine out, shop, and chat, making it a very pleasant experience. Secondly, the service and environment here are also top-notch. You can feel the special attention to service, which is very comforting, and everything runs smoothly. Of course, it does have some drawbacks. The most obvious one is its size; it's incredibly large. If you start walking from the ground floor, I feel like you wouldn't be able to cover everything even in a day, so it can be quite tiring after a while. Additionally, the prices here are not cheaper than those in smaller shops outside. A regular drink costs almost 30RMB, and the price of a single pair of shoes or a piece of clothing is also higher, ranging from hundreds to thousands.

### 饭店类

我想描述的饭店是我们本地的一个知名大型连锁饭店，名叫xxx，它就位于我住所的附近。这家饭店以其奢华的装修风格而闻名，店内环境干净卫生，给人一种非常舒适的感觉。服务体验也是一流的，员工们都非常专业和友好。饭店提供的菜品种类丰富，味道可口，服务也非常周到，总是能够满足顾客的需求。

饭店的布局设计也很合理，一楼是接待大厅，装饰豪华，给人一种高端大气的感觉。二楼到五楼是餐厅，每一层都有不同风格的装饰和菜品，满足不同顾客的口味和需求。五楼以上则是休息区，提供了一个安静舒适的环境，让顾客在用餐后可以放松身心。

通常，我们举办一些活动或者庆祝重要场合时，会选择在这个饭店进行，因为这里不仅菜品美味，服务周到，而且整体的氛围和环境都非常适宜。每次来这里，我们都能有一个非常满意的体验。

The restaurant I'd like to describe is a well-known local chain called "xxx" located near where I live. This establishment is renowned for its luxurious decoration style, clean and hygienic environment, and top-notch service experience. The staff are professional and friendly, always ready to meet customers' needs. The variety of dishes offered is extensive and delicious, with attentive service that caters to every patron's desires.

The layout of the restaurant is thoughtfully designed, with the first floor serving as a reception hall, adorned with opulent decorations that give off an upscale and grand impression. The second to fifth floors house the dining areas, each with a unique style and cuisine, catering to different tastes and preferences. Above the fifth floor, there are relaxation areas that provide a peaceful and comfortable environment for patrons to unwind after their meals.

We often choose this restaurant for events and celebrations due to its delicious food, attentive service, and the overall ambiance that is perfect for special occasions. Every visit here leaves us with a highly satisfactory experience.

### Device

接下来我要描述的电子设备是我的苹果笔记本电脑，它是我的主要生产力。

这个笔记本电脑是我攒了四个月的工资在苹果官网购买的，花了大概1.2w RMB。

我之前一直在用台式机，不过是 hackintosh，所以比较熟悉苹果的系统生态。至于为什么要换笔记本，主要有几点原因：1 是我的 hackintosh 总有一些小问题，虽然不影响正常使用，但这些小问题会比较碍眼。比如无法正常使用无线网络，尽管你可以使用有线网络连接，但是不能使用无线网络还是感觉很不方便，尤其是不能使用苹果自带的 AirDrop 功能。2 是由于我的工作性质，我是 R&D engineer，苹果笔记本电脑更合适编程使用。比如你可以随意使用 Visual Studio Code 或者 JetBrains IDE 进行开发工作，他们集成了编程所需的所有环境，非常的方便。

更重要的是，作为苹果自家的产品，MacBook Pro 可以使用非常多的原生功能，这些原生功能可能是 hackintosh 无法享有的。其次就是苹果的系统易用性要比 linux 和 windows 系统好很多，减少了配置成本。 

The electronic device I'm going to describe is my Apple MacBook Pro laptop, which is my primary productivity tool. I purchased this laptop after saving up for four months, and it cost me around 12,000 RMB from the official Apple website.

Before this, I was using a desktop computer, specifically a hackintosh, so I was quite familiar with Apple's ecosystem. The reason for switching to a laptop was multifaceted. Firstly, my hackintosh had minor issues that, while not impeding its functionality, were bothersome. For instance, it couldn't use wireless networks properly. Although I could connect via Ethernet, the inability to use wireless networks was inconvenient, especially since I couldn't utilize Apple's native AirDrop feature.

Secondly, due to my profession as an R&D engineer, an Apple laptop is more suitable for programming. You can seamlessly use development environments like Visual Studio Code or JetBrains IDEs for coding. They integrate all the necessary tools for programming, making the process incredibly convenient.

More importantly, as a native Apple product, the MacBook Pro has access to many features that a hackintosh might not. Additionally, Apple's system is much more user-friendly compared to Linux and Windows, significantly reducing the cost of configuration.

In summary, my Apple MacBook Pro laptop is an invaluable tool for my work and daily life. Its seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem, combined with its user-friendly interface and powerful capabilities, makes it a worthwhile investment.

### Normal Object

我想谈论一个我日常使用的物品，即我的小米屏幕挂灯，它是一种智能台灯。

小米屏幕挂灯以其简约的设计、便捷的安装、非对称光线设计和无线控制功能，为用户提供了一个实用且价格合理的屏幕挂灯选择。

这个台灯只需要挂在屏幕上即可使用，无需像普通台灯那样需要在桌面上单独占用一块地方。这个台灯的价格也比较合理，赶上优惠活动，它的性价比还是很高的。你可以随时通过米家APP控制这个台灯，调整它的光照强度等参数，非常的方便。

每天下班回来，只要语音说出：小爱同学，打开屏幕挂灯，它就会自动亮起，非常的智能，而且它亮起的那一刻，你的内心也会有种愉悦的感觉，感觉你的工作效率也提升了。

The item I'd like to talk about is a piece of everyday technology that I use, my Xiaomi Screen Lamp. This smart desk lamp is known for its minimalist design, easy installation, asymmetric light design, and wireless control features, offering users a practical and cost-effective option for a screen lamp.

The lamp is incredibly convenient to use; it simply hangs on the screen, taking up no additional space on the desk like traditional desk lamps. It's also reasonably priced, and when there are promotional offers, the value for money is quite high. You can control the lamp anytime through the Mi Home app, adjusting the light intensity and other settings, which is very convenient.

Every day when I come back from work, I just need to say, "Hey Xiao Ai, turn on the screen lamp," and it lights up automatically. It's incredibly smart, and the moment it lights up, I feel a sense of pleasure, as if my work efficiency has improved too.

## 4 Event

> what/where/when/why

### Festival

The festival I'd like to talk about is the Spring Festival, also known as Chinese New Year. It's the most significant and celebrated festival in China, and it marks the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunar calendar.

The Spring Festival is a time for family reunions. No matter how far away people are from home, they make every effort to return for this special occasion. It's a period filled with joy and warmth as families come together to celebrate and enjoy various activities. One of the most important aspects of the festival is the preparation. Houses are cleaned thoroughly to sweep away any ill-fortune, and everything is decorated with an array of red lanterns and couplets, which symbolize happiness and good fortune.

On New Year's Eve, families gather for a reunion dinner, which is a feast with a variety of dishes, each carrying its own symbolic meaning. For example, fish is a must-have dish because it represents abundance and prosperity. After dinner, it's customary to stay up late, which is called 'Shousui,' and it's believed to add years to one's life.

### Sports Event

我想要描述的一个运动是关于游泳比赛的。

我记得是我刚学游泳的那年夏天参加的，在我当地的一个体育馆里，具体时间应该是 2021 年的 6 月份。这个赛事主要是针对那些初学游泳的选手，只要你能在标准比赛泳池里不间断的游过50米就算成功，裁判会根据选手的不同用时颁发不同的证书。

因为是初学游泳，所以还不是很自信。比赛过程中感觉很紧张，再加上准备的不够充分，游到剩余10米的时候实在游不动了，手脚已经开始变得不再协调，导致换气也不是很顺畅，喝了不少泳池的水。最后很遗憾，我在中途停了下来，因此也与证书无缘。

事后回想起这件事情，感觉自己还是挺勇敢的。毕竟刚学不久，很多动作都不熟悉，最后竟然去参加了比赛，也算是重在参与吧。后续也会多多练习游泳，争取在下次比赛中能够坚持到最后。

The sport I'd like to talk about is a swimming competition that I participated in. It was the summer when I first learned how to swim, and the event took place at a local sports complex in June 2021. This competition was designed for beginners like myself, and the goal was to swim continuously for 50 meters in a standard pool. The judges would award different certificates based on the participants' times.

As a novice swimmer, I lacked confidence. During the race, I felt very nervous, and my preparation was not adequate. When I had only 10 meters left to go, I simply couldn't continue. My limbs started to lose coordination, which affected my breathing, and I ended up swallowing quite a bit of pool water. Regrettably, I had to stop halfway, and as a result, I didn't receive a certificate.

In retrospect, I feel quite brave for having participated at all, considering I had only recently learned to swim and many of the movements were still unfamiliar to me. It was an experience of participation. I will certainly practice swimming more and aim to complete the race next time.

### Concert/Music Event

The concert I'd like to talk about is one that really left a lasting impression on me. It was a local music festival held in my city's park last summer. The event was called "Summer Sounds," and it featured a mix of indie bands and a few well-known pop acts. 

The atmosphere was incredible; the park was transformed into a vibrant space filled with music lovers from all walks of life. There were food trucks selling all sorts of delicious treats, and people were dressed in casual summer attire, some even wearing band t-shirts or carrying signs to show support for their favorite performers.

What I loved most about this concert was the sense of community. Strangers became friends as they shared the experience of live music. There was a feeling of joy and freedom in the air, and everyone was there to have a good time. Even after the concert ended, people were still humming the tunes and discussing their favorite moments.

## 5 Activity

> what/where/who/why

### Sport

今天我要描述的活动是户外健身，主要是一些动作的组合，这是一个非常有意思且容易开展的活动。

户外健身这个活动是没有场地要求的，只要在空旷的地方都可以完成这个活动。你可以选择公园或者广场，我通常就在楼下的下广场做这个活动。

我做这个活动的频率还是比较高的。通常来说，我每天都会做一遍这活动，时间集中在工作日下班回来后，大概下午 6 点左右，周末的话稍作休息。

做这个活动的主要原因有以下几点：1 是可以提高我的免疫力，用来抵抗流感等疾病；我生活的地方相对较冷，再加上我的鼻炎和鼻窦炎问题，导致我很容易产生炎症，因此我需要找一个办法来解决这个问题，那么户外健身这个运动正合适，可以从根本上提升我的免疫力，减少发病几率。2 是可以减肥。目前我的体重在100kg之上，有时候上楼梯也会觉着有点喘，需要控制体重来提升心肺功能。这个活动可以很好的为我减少体重，目前已经减掉3kg了。3 是做这个活动可以提升我的注意力。一天的工作或者学习会让我消耗很多精神，需要在外面透透气，这样会让我感觉更有活力，整个人都神清气爽。

The activity I'd like to describe today is outdoor fitness, which primarily consists of a combination of exercises. It's a highly enjoyable and accessible activity that can be done by anyone.

There are no specific venue requirements for outdoor fitness; any open space will suffice. You can opt for a park or a square, but I usually perform this activity in the square downstairs from my home.

The frequency with which I engage in this activity is quite high. Generally, I do it every day, focusing on weekdays after work, around 6 pm in the evening, and I take a slight break during the weekends.

There are several main reasons why I do this activity. Firstly, it significantly boosts my immune system, which helps me combat illnesses like the flu. Living in a relatively cold area and suffering from rhinitis and sinusitis, I'm prone to inflammation. Outdoor fitness is an ideal solution to enhance my immunity fundamentally and reduce the likelihood of getting sick.

Secondly, it aids in weight loss. Currently, I weigh over 100kg, and sometimes I find myself out of breath just climbing stairs. Controlling my weight is essential for improving my cardiorespiratory function. This activity has been effective in helping me shed weight; I've already lost 3kg.

Lastly, engaging in this activity enhances my concentration. A day filled with work or study can be mentally exhausting, and taking a break outdoors to breathe some fresh air makes me feel more energetic and refreshed.

In conclusion, outdoor fitness is my favorite activity because it not only strengthens my body but also refreshes my mind. It's a holistic approach to staying healthy and maintaining a positive outlook on life.

### Game

what、where、who、why

我想介绍的这个游戏是狼人杀，它里面有几个角色，包括狼人、武士、女巫、预言家和村民等，我们最终的目标是要找出那些狼人，否则狼人获胜。

当时我们团队在北京的一个休闲娱乐室团建，我记得具体位置应该是在西三旗附近。饭后， leader 组织大家说一起做个游戏，和总监一起玩狼人杀，我们感觉很有意思，我的同事就都围过来一起玩。

这个游戏本身是兼具策略和推理的游戏，需要你根据每个人的发言来判断他说的是真还是假，逻辑性要求比较高。过程中，主持人给每个人发一张牌，这张牌上标识了你是上面说的某个身份。之后按序号每人描述一句话，你可以说任何话，但不能与之前的人一致，只要不暴露你自己的身份即可。一轮下来后，每个人根据大家说的话进行投票，推测出谁是狼人。票数最多的人会被淘汰，之后主持人会公布被淘汰的人的身份。如果猜错的话，大家会一顿嘘唏，猜对了，大家则高声欢呼，跃跃欲试找出下一个狼人。

那天我们一直从晚上8点玩到11点，大家精力依旧旺盛。如果不是因为娱乐室要关门，我想我们还会玩个通宵。事后大家的反馈都很好，非常期待下一次的参与。

The game I'd like to introduce is called "Werewolf Kill," also known as "Werewolf" or "Mafia." It's a strategy and deduction game where players take on different roles such as werewolves, warriors, witches, seers, and villagers. The ultimate goal is to identify the werewolves before they eliminate everyone else, or else the werewolves win.

We played this game during a team-building event at a leisure and entertainment venue in Beijing, near Xisanqi. After dinner, our leader suggested we play a game together with the director, and everyone found it quite interesting. My colleagues gathered around to join in the fun.

The game is a blend of strategy and logic. You have to judge whether each player's statement is true or false based on their arguments. The game master gives each person a card indicating their role. Then, in turn, each player says one sentence, which should not be the same as anyone else's and should not reveal their identity. After everyone has spoken, players vote based on the statements to guess who the werewolves might be. The person with the most votes is eliminated, and the game master then reveals their identity. There's a collective groan if we guess wrong, and cheers if we're right, as we eagerly try to find the next werewolf.

We played from 8 pm until 11 pm that night, and everyone was still full of energy. If it weren't for the venue closing, I think we would have played all night. After thats, the feedback was very positive, and everyone is looking forward to participating in the next session.

## 6 Favourites

> what/why

### Film/Movie

我想要介绍的电影是变形金刚，它的画面感十足，非常推荐去看。前几部基本都是在它刚上映的那天我就会去电影院看，真的非常的震撼。最近我在线上刚看了最新的那部，名字叫做起源。至此，所有的情节就都串起来了。

变形金刚主要是讲赛博坦星球遭遇暴乱后，擎天柱带领一众汽车人逃亡到地球，而威震天穷追不舍抢夺晶石的故事。

我喜欢这一系列电影主要有2个原因。第一，我很享受电影背景音乐的恢弘与震撼，让我感觉身临其境。如果你去过3D电影院，你就会知道我描述的那种感觉是多么地奇妙。他们让你带上3D眼镜，你真的就像在剧情里一样让人惊心动魄。其次，电影的特效非常的逼真。你很难想象这是我们当今世界的技术，看着非常的高端，未来科技感十足。

每当我看完这类型的电影后，我的内心就感觉十分的震撼，甚至有点义愤填膺的感觉，想要为汽车人或者说正派打爆不平。反派的存在也让电影得到升华，毕竟并不是所有的过程都是美好的。联想到生活，电影其实就是我们生活的真实写照，更是人性的映射。我们既要相信美好的事情即将发生，也要未雨绸缪当下的苦难。

The movie I'd like to introduce is "Transformers." It's a film with a strong visual impact, and I highly recommend watching it. I've seen the first few installments on their opening day in the cinema, and they were truly stunning. Recently, I watched the latest one online, titled "Origin," and now all the plotlines have come together.

"Transformers" is primarily about the planet Cybertron in chaos, with Optimus Prime leading the Autobots to escape to Earth, while Megatron relentlessly pursues them to seize the cube. There are two main reasons why I enjoy this film series. First, I really enjoy the grand and powerful background music that makes me feel immersed in the experience. If you've been to a 3D cinema, you'll understand how wonderful the feeling I'm describing is. When you put on the 3D glasses, it's like being in the story, thrilling and heart-pounding. Secondly, the special effects in the movie are incredibly realistic. It's hard to believe this is the technology of our current world; it looks very advanced and futuristic.

After watching this type of movie, I feel deeply moved and even a bit indignant, wanting to fight for the Autobots or the good guys. The presence of the villains also elevates the movie, as not all processes are pleasant. Relating to life, the movie is actually a true reflection of our lives and a mirror of human nature. We must believe that good things are about to happen while also preparing for the current hardships.

### Book

我想要表述的这本书叫《君主论》，它是意大利政治学家和思想家尼克罗马基雅维利创作的政治学著作。这本书主要是马基雅维利根据自己的从政经验和政治思考总结的君主治国之道，以及国家统一后对权利和人性的认知。

这本书是我在几个月前读到的，是 Bilibili 一位博主推荐给我的。这本书比较难懂，需要多读几遍，所以我花了不少时间才读完第一遍，我想大概是 2 个月吧。当你读过这本书后，会对这个世界有更深层次的认知。

这本书里有一句话让我很有感触，也正是因为这句话我才对这本书有了较大的兴趣，这句话是：“命运是我们半个行动的主宰”。这句话不同人读可能会有不同的感想，对我来说，我的理解是命运具有强大的影响力以及我们个人是具有主观能动性的。前者是说我们生活的环境其实是不可预测的，很多时候我们根本无法改变任何事情，比如你的出生。后者是说我们其实有掌握命运的能力，我们需要努力学习并把机会掌握在手中，在一定程度上你还是可以改变你的命运的，比如通过学习考取名牌大学。

所以，我们既要敬畏命运，又要充分发挥自己的主观能动性，积极追求自己的目标。

The book I'd like to talk about is "The Prince" by the Italian political philosopher and thinker Niccolò Machiavelli. It's a treatise on political philosophy that Machiavelli wrote based on his own experiences in politics and his reflections on how to govern a nation effectively and maintain power.

I came across this book a few months ago through a recommendation from a Bilibili blogger. It's a challenging read and requires multiple readings to fully grasp, so it took me about two months to finish the first read-through. Once you delve into it, it offers profound insights into the world and the nature of power.

One quote from the book that resonated with me and sparked my interest is: "Fortune is the arbiter of half of our actions." This statement can be interpreted differently by different people. For me, it means that fate has a significant influence over our lives, and there are aspects we can't predict or change, such as our birth. However, it also implies that we have the agency to shape our destinies. We have the power to seize opportunities through hard work and learning, and to some extent, we can alter the course of our lives, like getting into a prestigious university through education.

Therefore, we should respect the power of fate while also leveraging our own initiative to actively pursue our goals.

### Song

这首歌是一首抒情甚至有点悲伤的音乐，当然也和你当时听音乐的心境有关。这首歌是对《Oliver Tree》原作的塞尔维亚语改编版本，是一位塞尔维亚男歌手唱的，名字是 Luke Black。

这首歌有点特殊，我并没有经常听，而是在一些特定的时间点和地点才会听。通常情况下，我在想我爷爷的时候，尤其是在坐火车或者城际大巴的时候，我会听这首歌。

我确实很喜欢这首歌，它会让我想起我的爷爷。另一方面，这首歌的曲调构造和我当时听这首歌时的心境非常的一致，都是悲伤的，以及这首歌所描绘的景象让我有比较深的共鸣。这首歌和当时的我产生了非常强的联结，算是触景生情。每当我听到这首歌是，就会想起我的爷爷。当然，这个改编的版本已经不再是简单的 Oliver tree 了，歌词也发生了变化。我感觉这首歌就是在描述我爷爷的离开，以及会去往何方。

听这首歌最大的感受就是悲伤和遗憾。为什么这么说呢？因为当时我在读研究生，有天晚上我突然梦到我的爷爷去世了，然后就哭着醒来了。转念想了想，爷爷应该没有什么事情吧，最近也没有听到什么不好的消息，所以我也就没有给家里打电话以及给爷爷打电话确认。实际上，我是10号早晨做梦哭醒的，爷爷是在10号晚上23点48分去世的。11号早上，我母亲打电话告诉我爷爷去世了，我整个人都崩溃了，后悔和痛苦夹杂其中。之后我收拾东西从学校往家里赶。在火车上也不知道为啥，整个车厢就我一个人，我就一直在想这个事情。然后带上耳机想听听音乐，音乐软件就随机播放了这首歌曲。歌手唱到副歌部分，我的眼泪就止不住地往下流，一直持续了很久。

The song I'm going to talk about is a lyrical and somewhat sad piece of music. It's a Serbian adaptation of the original "Oliver Tree," performed by a Serbian male singer named Luke Black.

This song holds a special place in my heart as I don't listen to it often, but rather associate it with specific moments and locations. Typically, I play it when I'm thinking of my grandfather, especially when I'm on a train or an intercity bus.

I truly cherish this song because it reminds me of my grandfather. The melody and the mood I'm in when I listen to it are both tinged with sadness, and the imagery it conveys resonates deeply with me. The song has formed a strong connection with my emotions, almost like a reflection of my feelings. Every time I hear it, my thoughts turn to my grandfather. Of course, this adapted version is more than just a "lemon tree" now; the lyrics have changed, and it feels like the song is narrating my grandfather's departure and the uncertainty of where he has gone.

The overwhelming feeling I get from listening to this song is one of sorrow and regret. I say this because I was in graduate school when I had a dream one night that my grandfather had passed away. I woke up crying, but then I thought maybe it was just a dream, and since I hadn't heard any bad news recently, I didn't call home or my grandfather to check.

In reality, I had the dream and woke up crying on the 10th, and my grandfather passed away at 23:48 on the same night. The next morning, my mother called to tell me the news, and I was devastated, filled with regret and pain. I then packed up and rushed home from school. On the train, for some reason, I was the only one in the carriage, and I couldn't stop thinking about my grandfather. I put on my headphones, intending to listen to some music, and the music app played this song at random. When the singer reached the chorus, I couldn't hold back my tears, and they flowed for a long time.

### Website/App

我想要描述的网站叫 v2ex，全称即 we to explore。

我大概是在2017年左右发现这个网站的，更确切的说，应该是微信群的网友推荐的。这个网站是一个由程序员驱动的开放社区，旨在共同探索未知可能性。大家可以在这里分享相关经验互相学习，一起讨论某些话题寻求解决方案，有点类似 Reddit 或者 Hackernews 那种形态，但又不完全一致。

我基本上每天都会看一下这个网站的最新动态，就像每天都会看邮件一样。因为我自己也会在上面发表主题，有时也会为别人提供帮助。

这个网站能获得成功离不开以下几个原因，这也是我喜欢这个网站的原因：一是这个社区是由一群有爱的人驱动的，它是开放的、多样性的且包容的一个社区。你可以在上面提问或者发表任何合规的主题，人们很乐意帮你出谋划策甚至分享一些相关经验，你可以学到很多东西。其次，这个网站也是一个共享平台，比如人们会在上面发表一些工作机会甚至是一些二手物品交易，每个人在这里都可以得到自己想要的东西。最终，它是完全免费的，你只需要注册即可使用网站的全部功能。不像其他网站你需要充会员才能使用高级功能，某些情况下，这会打击用户的积极性。

The website I'd like to describe is called v2ex, which stands for 'we to explore'. I discovered this site around 2017, and to be precise, it was recommended by a friend in a WeChat group. V2ex is an open community driven by programmers, aimed at exploring the unknown together. It's a place where people can share experiences, learn from each other, and discuss topics to find solutions. It's somewhat similar to platforms like Reddit or Hacker News, yet it has its own unique features.

I check the latest updates on this site almost every day, just as I would with my emails. I also post topics on v2ex and sometimes offer help to others.

There are several reasons why this website has been successful, which are also the reasons I like it. First, the community is driven by a group of loving individuals. It's an open, diverse, and inclusive community where you can ask questions or post any compliant topics. People are more than willing to help you brainstorm and share relevant experiences, so there's a lot to learn. Secondly, the site serves as a sharing platform where people post job opportunities and even second-hand item transactions. Everyone can find something they want here. Lastly, it's entirely free. You just need to register to use all the features of the site. Unlike other sites where you need to pay for a membership to access advanced features, which can sometimes demotivate users, v2ex offers everything for free.

### Advertisement

> 这个广告是什么，你从哪里以及什么时间看到的，广告的内容是什么，为什么想要介绍这个广告。

我想要描述的这个广告的主题是：Be yourself, you are the main theme of your life.

这个广告是我在一个视频平台上看到，就在前几天。这个广告的只有几十秒，讲述的是一个普通打扮的年轻男性正准备过斑马线，双向的车都停了下来等待他过斑马线。这个男士看了看两边，迈起脚步走上斑马线。下一秒，这个男士的穿着打扮已然变成了一个美女的打扮，他身穿一套极其精致的红色连衣裙和红色高跟鞋，行走间肌肉线条分明，裙摆随风飘扬，他自信的走过斑马线，引来路两边的车主都震惊的看向他。到此这个广告就结束了，屏幕上出现一行字：Be yourself。

说实话，我还是很羡慕他的自信以及对自己的认同感。我们每个人都有自己的选择，可能碍于世俗的眼光，不敢去追求自己喜欢的事物或者情感，永远都在压抑自己。如果有那一天这个世间上不再有世俗的评判，每个人都可以像广告中的男士一样自信，那么这个世界会变得更加包容开放，也会更有创造性。

The advertisement I'd like to describe has a powerful theme: "Be yourself, you are the main theme of your life." I came across this ad on a video platform just a few days ago. It was a short clip, only a few seconds long, but it left a lasting impression on me.

The ad features an ordinary young man dressed in casual clothes, preparing to cross a zebra crossing. Cars from both directions stop to let him pass. He looks both ways and starts to cross. In the next moment, his appearance transforms into that of a beautiful woman, wearing an exquisite red dress and high heels. His muscles are defined, the skirt billows in the wind, and he walks with confidence across the crossing, drawing shocked looks from the drivers on both sides of the road. The ad ends there, with the screen displaying the words: "Be yourself."

To be honest, I admire the confidence and self-acceptance portrayed by the character in the ad. Each of us has our own choices, but often, due to societal judgment, we hesitate to pursue what we truly like or feel, always suppressing ourselves. If there comes a day when the world is free from judgmental attitudes, and everyone can be as confident as the man in the ad, I believe the world would become more tolerant, open, and creative.
