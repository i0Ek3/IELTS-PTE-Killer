### Key Sentences

- 30 Lozanov claims that teachers should train students to
  - 定位句：In suggestopedia, as he called his method, consciousness is shifted away from the curriculum to focus on something peripheral.
    - shifted away from the curriculum to focus on something peripheral 与 C 选项是同义
    - C：think about something other than the curriculum content
- 31 In the example of suggestopedic teaching in the fourth paragraph, the only variable that changes is the music.
  - 定位句：The teacher reads the text slowly and solemnly, with attention to the dynamics of the music. ...in the second part…while the teacher reads the text in a normal speaking voice.
  - 音乐从第一阶段的古典音乐到了第二阶段的巴洛克式音乐，老师也从第一阶段的“用缓慢且庄严的语调朗读课文”变成了第二阶段的“用正常声调朗读课文”。这就证明改变的不仅仅是音乐，还有老师的朗读方法。因此，题干的描述是错误的
  - 此外，如果选项中出现过于绝对的词，如only，never或all的时候，那么这个选项往往是错误的
