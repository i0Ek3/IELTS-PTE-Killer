15 没有定位词，但是时间关系词表明 B 段是在描述 farming 的几个阶段。 

16 C 段中的 That is mainly because the costs of all this damage are what economists refer to as externalities 表明，hidden costs 被经济学家称为 externality。

读了大半天，为句子找出 ending。感觉这种题目是 summary 和 heading 以及 matching 的杂交版本，难度较大。

主要是 37 找了很久，原因是我把 motorised vehicles 理解成了摩托车了，所以和题干中的 buses and trucks 对不上，实际它的意思是机动车。不过好在原文中后面的部分可以用来匹配选项，并不是很成功可以对应选项中的 hinder。

16 题干 some evidence to confirm a theory about the purpose of the red leaves，定位句 Even if you had never suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn red, there are clues out there.

17 题干 an explanation of the function of chlorophyll，定位句 …chlorophyll, the molecule that captures sunlight and converts that energy into newbuilding materials for the tree.

18 题干 a suggestion that the red colouration in leaves could serve as a warning signal，定位句 It has also been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince herbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able to mount chemical defences against infestation. If insects paid attention to such advertisements, they might be prompted to lay their eggs on a duller, and presumably less resistant host.

24 …blood samples from three widely separated Native American groups: Pima-Papago Indians in Arizona, … , and Ticuna Indians...all three groups appear to be descended from the same ancestral (Paleo-Indian) population. 说明 Pima-Papago 属于 Paleo-Indian，属于 first wave。

24 定位句中出现 He took action despite his own pain --- a typical response of an optimist，与题干描述一致。

26 定位句 For marketing executive Kenneth Pedeleose, it meant speaking out against something he thought was ethically wrong. ...knowing his own job security would be threatened…, Pedeleose's story proves the point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by moral obligation 与题干同义。

真的崩溃，匹配题就是我的克星啊！

32 都是找的同一个定位句 For the better part of a century, most biologists have been reluctant to use those words, mindful of a principle of evolution that says 'evolution cannot run backwards'，与选项 F the possibility of evolution being reversible 描述的一致。

33 找的还是同一个定位句 While Lombroso was measuring criminals, a Belgjan palacontologist called Louis Dollo was studying fossil records and coming to the opposite conclusion，因为题干理解偏差，导致错选。题干问的是相反观点两方的代表是谁，仅 G 符合。

35 找错定位句，正确定位句为 One possibility is that these traits are lost and then simply reappear, in much the same way that similar structures can independently arise in unrelated species, such as the dorsal fins of sharks and killer whales，与选项 B 描述一致。

36 定位句 The simplest explanation is that the toed lineages never lost their toes, but Wagner begs to differ，与选项 D 描述一致，即基因一致存在。

- axolotl 蝾螈
- minuscule 极小的；微小的

## C11-T1-P3

5/7.

27 定位句 The idea is modelled on historic volcanic explosions, such as that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, which led to a short term cooling of global temperatures by 0.5°C，题干说的是 earlier natural phenomenon，与原文中的 historic volcanic explosions 对应，因此选 D。感觉这道题目可能不太好找两个词组的对应关系。

29 定位句 Consequently, an increasing number of scientists are beginning to explore the alternative of geo-engineering- a term which generally refers to the international large-scale manipulation of the environment 提到 term 一词，表明存在定义，与题干吻合。

6 找错了定位句，实际定位句为 Having said that, Reed adds, the latest work in epigenetics promises to take our understanding further，与题干同义，故选 Reed。

- trailblazer 创始人；先驱；拓荒者；开路先锋

24 没找到定位句，随便选了一个，果然错了。实际定位句为 The entire sound track consists of three essential ingredients: the human voice, sound effects and music. These three tracks must be mixed and balanced so as to produce the necessary emphases which in turn create desired effects，比较难理解的是 create desired effects = can be controlled。

这种很难定位的问题还有另一个解法：可等到其他更好找到的题目都得出答案以后，在剩余选项中利用句意和逻辑的匹配关系来寻找最合适的选项。比如本题如果留到最后，选项中的 A 和 E 项已经被选过，则可以尝试利用对文章内容的已知信息，对比剩余的 B、C、D 三个选项，找出在意思上最为匹配的答案 C。
