# How to Answer Part 2?

基于[杨帅对 Challenge 的回答](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mItlSk4ckwl3rj7t8ix-tg)修改而来。

## 示例题目

**Describe a challenge you faced that you thought was rather difficult**

**You should say:**

  **what it was**

  **when and where you faced it**

  **why you thought it was a difficult challenge**

**and explain how you felt at the time**

## 回答模板

实际上对示例题目的每一条问题进行逐一回答即可，只不过在回答过程中对内容稍作扩充，同时注意语法、时态、从句等的使用即可。

### 回答的第一段

先概述下你要讲述的故事，简单交待即可。对应 **what it was**。

Well, I’m going to describe the time \<具体的事情>. Yeah, that was the challenge - \<具体的挑战>.

### 回答的第二段

说明这个具体的事件：说明具体的时间/节日/假期，要去哪里，此行的目的是什么。对应 **when and where you faced it**。

It was this January, during the Chinese New Year holiday. It was during my winter holiday, and my parents also had seven days off work, so we went to visit America. Our destination was America partly because I was going to take this English test, and my parents figured that the trip could help me improve my English.

### 回答的第三段

点明主题：为什么会觉着是挑战，举例说明。对应  **why you thought it was a difficult challenge**。

I thought it was difficult just because I’d never flown for that long before. I had only traveled domestically prior to that trip, and the flights only took 3 or 4 hours, at most. For example, Beijing is in the north of China, and Hainan Island is in the very south, but it’s only a 4-hour flight.

### 回答的第四段

具体描述主题：这个挑战是什么，你的感受是什么，怎么克服/解决的，举例说明。对应  **explain how you felt at the time**。

As for this flight to California ... I was stuck in my seat, a middle seat, with very little leg room. It was uncomfortable whether I was awake or asleep. To cope with that, when I was not sleeping, I was watching movies. I remember I finished two *Fast and Furious* movies during the flight.

### 回答的第五段

小结：说明克服/解决这个挑战后你的感受，以及下次再遇到类似的问题你会怎么处理。

The moment I got off the plane, I was so happy, excited, actually, not only for the trip ahead, but also because the ordeal was over. Of course, there was also the return trip, haha, but I wasn’t thinking about that then.

ordeal 考验
